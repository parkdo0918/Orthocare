A knee effusion refers to an abnormal fluid accumulation within the knee\njoint. Knee effusions can arise from traumatic injuries, such as ligament tears or fractures, inflammatory conditions\nlike arthritis, infectious processes such as septic arthritis, or degenerative changes such as osteoarthritis. Factors like\nage, activity level, and systemic health conditions may influence the presentation and management of knee effusions.\nTherefore, a comprehensive evaluation considering structural changes, potential causes, and patient factors is essential\nfor optimizing care for individuals with knee effusions.\nThis activity is designed to develop learners' proficiency in evaluating and managing knee effusions. Participants gain\nvaluable insights into the condition's possible etiologies, appropriate diagnostic modalities, and evidence-based\ninterventions, allowing them to collaborate effectively within an interprofessional team caring for patients with knee\neffusions.\nObjectives:\nIdentify the signs and symptoms suggestive of a knee effusion.\nDetermine a clinically guided diagnostic workup for a patient with a possible knee effusion.\nDevelop a personalized management strategy for a patient diagnosed with a knee effusion.\nEnhance communication and collaboration within an interprofessional team caring for patients with knee\neffusions to formulate holistic short- and long-term management plans and improve outcomes.\nAccess free multiple choice questions on this topic.\nIntroduction\nThe knee is a hinge joint, one of the most frequently injured joints in the body. This joint contains multiple bursae\nor saclike structures containing synovial fluid. The bursae are located between the skin and bony prominences. Some\nof these bursae communicate with the knee joint. Fluid accumulation in a joint's intraarticular space and bursae is\ncalled an \"effusion.\" \nKnee effusions can occur at any age. The condition often presents with knee swelling, pain, stiffness, and limited\nrange of motion. Knee effusions arise from various causes. Proper diagnosis and management typically involve\nidentifying the effusion's underlying cause through clinical evaluation, imaging studies, and possibly joint fluid\nanalysis. Treatment may include rest, ice, elevation, anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy, and, in some\ncases, knee fluid drainage.[1]\nEtiology1 2 3\n1\n2\n325. 11. 13. 오전  2:27 Knee Effusion - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532279/?report=printable 1/10",

More significant joint effusions indicate pathology.\nLarge effusions can give rise to cysts within the popliteal fossa. A knee effusion can consist of synovial fluid or\nhemarthrosis and is classified as traumatic or nontraumatic. Knee joint hemarthrosis' primary mechanism is forced\nrotation of the loaded joint.[3] \nHemarthrosis' articular cartilage complications are similar across different age groups, but the etiology varies. In\nadults, traumatic hemarthrosis may be due to anterior cruciate ligament ruptures (70%), patellar dislocation (15%),\nmeniscal tears (10%), osteochondral fragment fractures (5%), and miscellaneous injuries (5%).[4][5][6] Patellar\ndislocation was reported to be the most common etiology of traumatic hemarthrosis in adolescent age groups.[7][8] \nEpidemiology\nKnee injuries represent over half a million emergency department visits in the United States.[9][10] The knee is\nmore frequently injured than other joints because it is part of a weight-bearing limb and has less joint congruity than\nthe hip and ankle.[11] \nThe lifetime prevalence of knee swelling has been reported to be as high as 27%.[12] Knee effusions in children most\ncommonly affect infants and teenagers. Pediatric knee effusion with hemarthrosis usually arises from a sports-related\ntraumatic knee event.\nPathophysiology\nA knee effusion may arise from an acute or chronic, inflammatory or noninflammatory, traumatic or atraumatic\ncondition. The most common diagnoses in the primary care setting are osteoarthritis, trauma, and gout.[13] A knee\nhemarthrosis increases the intracapsular pressure, leading to pain and reduced knee joint range of motion mainly due\nto reflex quadriceps muscle firing inhibition.[14] The risk of developing osteoarthritis from longstanding\nknee hemarthrosis increases regardless of etiology. Blood and other inflammatory mediators released into the joint\ninitiate the pathological process of chondral injury. Complex biochemical interactions between various metabolites\nand proinflammatory mediators culminate in irreversible articular cartilage damage and joint degeneration as long-\nterm sequelae.[15][16]\nHistopathology\nNormally, synovial fluid hyaluronic acid prevents friction and lubricates the knee joint. Synovial fluid has\nantibacterial properties that help maintain a sterile environment within the joint. However, synovial microscopic\nexamination of knee joint effusion reveals abnormal changes. Knee joint effusion consists of synovial fluid and blood\nplasma ultrafiltrate and includes hyaluronic acid, glycoproteins, lubricin, proteinases, and collagenases. Inflamed\nsynovium contains large clefts, allowing molecules of almost any size to pass through its membrane and cause an\neffusion. Synovial fluid also contains substances identical to plasma proteins.\nHistory and Physical\nHistory\nEvaluating an acutely swollen knee begins with a thorough history and examination of the affected and contralateral\nknees. Essential information to elicit include the injury mechanism, onset acuity, symptom duration, previous history\nof the ailing joint, aggravating symptoms, and associated systemic manifestations. A knee effusion with a recent\ntraumatic history may suggest an internal derangement such as a ligament or meniscal tear. In contrast, an atraumatic\neffusion is highly suspicious for infection or systemic disease. A history of previous surgery should be determined in\nevery patient with knee swelling. Patients may complain of swelling and stiffness with decreased range of motion. A\nlarge effusion can cause the inability to completely extend the knee. The patient may keep the knee at 15° of flexion\nwhen at rest.\nRed flags25. 11. 13. 오전  2:27 Knee Effusion - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532279/?report=printable 2/10",

These red flags typically indicate immediate evaluation. The affected knee should always\nbe compared with the unaffected knee. In septic arthritis, joint pain, a history of joint swelling, and fever are present\nin over 50% of cases.[17] \nPhysical Examination\nPhysical examination should focus on finding signs that can help determine the knee effusion's etiology. Comparing\nthe contralateral knee is mandatory and always helpful in spotting abnormalities (see Image. Knee Effusion).\nInspection\nThe absence of dimples is the first sign of effusion and may be easily noted when comparing the affected knee to the\ncontralateral one. Patellar swelling and suprapatellar bursal distention may be found in more significant effusions.\nDeformities and dislocations are noticeable in most scenarios. Skin evaluation for color changes, such as erythema,\nmay indicate underlying sepsis. The presence of a rash could direct the physician to further investigate for systemic\ndisorders, particularly rheumatologic, hematologic, and vasculitic conditions. The patient's gait and lower limb\nalignment should also be evaluated. Malalignment accompanying chronic conditions may indicate the effusion's\nunderlying etiology. \nPalpation\nThe bony and soft tissue landmarks and the joint line should be gently palpated. Joint-line tenderness could indicate\nmeniscal pathology. Tenderness over a tendon or ligamentous insertion could indicate tendonitis or apophysitis.\nTenderness over the femoral condyles' articular surfaces may indicate osteochondritis dissecans. A subjective joint\npain with no objective tenderness over bony or soft tissue structures most likely points toward arthralgia.\nRange of motion assessment\nPatients may have a restricted range of motion and pain with ambulation. Excess fluid can cause pressure and\nirritation within the joint, contributing to pain and discomfort during weight-bearing activities like walking.\nSpecial tests\nThe balloon, ballottement, and bulge tests can help confirm knee effusion. The balloon test is performed by\ncompressing the suprapatellar pouch against the femur with the thumb and fingers, making the effusion more\nappreciable. The ballottement test is performed as a continuation of the balloon test by pressing the raised patella\ndownward against the femur. A gentle patellar tap and float should be appreciated. The bulge test is performed when\nonly minimal effusion is apparent on inspection. The effusion may be appreciated by milking all the fluid laterally and\npressing it until it forms a medial bulge.\nThe following special tests may be performed if suspecting specific injuries:\nMcMurray and Thessaly tests for medial and lateral meniscus tears\nLachman and anterior drawer tests for an anterior cruciate ligament tear\nPosterior drawer test for posterior cruciate ligament tear\nVarus and valgus stress tests for lateral and medial collateral ligament injuries, respectively\nPatellofemoral joint compression test for patellofemoral compartment pathology [18]  \nNeurovascular assessment\nKnee effusions may cause arterial flow reduction and nerve compression, warranting immediate intervention. The\nfollowing structures may be compromised by mass effects arising from a knee effusion:\nPopliteal artery, affecting downstream vessels like the anterior and posterior tibial arteries and dorsalis pedis\nPeroneal nerve25. 11. 13. 오전  2:27 Knee Effusion - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532279/?report=printable 3/10",

Posterior tibial nerve function may be examined by ankle\nplantar flexion. The superficial peroneal nerve's function may be evaluated by ankle eversion. Great-toe extension\nstrength testing can help test deep peroneal nerve function. Lower limb sensory tests must also be completed.\nEvaluation\nImaging\nWeight-bearing radiographs in 3 planes—anteroposterior, lateral, and axial—are indicated in patients presenting with\nan acutely swollen knee. Radiography helps evaluate for a fracture, especially if a history of trauma has been\nelicited. Plain x-rays can also detect rheumatoid arthritis-related erosive disease. Joint space narrowing may be found\nin patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.[19]\nA fabella—a sesamoid bone in the gastrocnemius lateral head tendon—may be seen in some individuals' lateral knee\nx-rays. This structure can serve as a radioopaque marker for the knee synovium's posterior border. The fabella sign\n(fabella displacement) is seen in the presence of a synovial effusion and a popliteal mass. Increased suprapatellar\nbursal opacity and widening may also be evident on lateral knee radiographs showing the fabella sign.\nAn ultrasound can help differentiate between complicated and simple effusions. This modality may also be used\nto guide arthrocentesis.\nKnee arthroscopy is the gold standard diagnostic modality for evaluating and managing intraarticular knee\npathologies. Clinical examination or magnetic resonance imaging scans are not 100% sensitive in excluding\nintraarticular pathologies.\nSynovial Fluid Aspirate Analysis\nArthrocentesis and subsequent synovial fluid analysis should be done in all cases of unexplained knee effusion. The\naspirated fluid should be analyzed for cell counts, gram staining, bacterial cultures, and crystal analysis.\nThe following should be included in the synovial fluid aspirate analysis report:\nComplete cell count with differential (white blood cell or WBC, polymorphonuclear or PMN leukocytes)\nCrystal examination \nBacterial culture and gram staining\nViscosity \nGlucose\nHemarthrosis is commonly caused by joint trauma. Polarized microscopy can detect fat droplets, indicating an\narticular fracture. Other clotting disorders like hemophilia can cause hemarthrosis in the absence of trauma.\nThe presence of crystals cannot exclude septic arthritis with certainty. Septic arthritis can occur concurrently with\ngout or pseudogout in less than 5% of cases. Meanwhile, a low synovial fluid glucose level suggests joint\ninfection. Still, low glucose levels are present in only about 50% of patients with septic joints. Rheumatoid arthritis\nmay also have low synovial fluid glucose. The fasting glucose levels in synovial fluid obtained from joint effusions\nare typically less than half of the glucose levels simultaneously measured in the blood. In rheumatoid arthritis, expect\ndecreased viscosity and poor mucin clot formation.[20]\nSeptic arthritis\nSeptic arthritis produces a characteristic combination of synovial fluid aspirate analysis findings. Joint fluid often\nappears cloudy or purulent. A cell count with WBCs of more than 50,000 cells/mm is considered diagnostic for\nseptic arthritis. However, lower counts do not rule out a joint infection.[21] A prosthetic joint with WBCs greater than\n1,100 cells/μL is considered septic. Gram stains only identify infective organisms a third of the time. Glucose will be\nless than 50% of the serum level.325. 11. 13. 오전  2:27 Knee Effusion - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532279/?report=printable 4/10",

Other causes include osteonecrosis, Charcot arthropathy, sarcoidosis,\namyloidosis, hypothyroidism, and acromegaly. Inflammatory arthritis, with synovial fluid WBCs greater than 2000\ncells/mL, may arise from infection, autoimmune disease, and crystal-induced arthritis. Aspiration of dark brown\nserosanguinous fluid should raise the possibility of pigmented villonodular synovitis.\nInflammatory synovial fluid\nVarious conditions present with synovial fluid WBC count greater than 2,000 leukocytes/mL. These clinical\nentities may be distinguished based on leukocytosis severity and differential count. Trauma often manifests with less\nthan 5000 WBCS/mL. RBCs may also be seen if bleeding occurs in the joint. Toxic synovitis usually has 5,000 to\n15,000/mL and less than 25% PMNs. Acute rheumatic fever often has 10,000 to 15,000 and 50% PMNs. Juvenile\nrheumatoid arthritis and various other autoimmune conditions usually have 15,000 to 80,000 and 75% PMNs.\nInfectious arthritis usually causes the most intense synovial fluid leukocytosis, with cell counts of 50,000 to 200,000\ncells/mL containing over 90% PMNs. Lower leukocyte counts in suspected infectious cases are common in early\nbacterial arthritis and disseminated gonococcal infection.\nNoninfectious conditions like gout, pseudogout, acute rheumatic fever, reactive arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis\ncan produce a markedly inflammatory synovial effusion. A finding of greater than 90% PMNs despite a relatively low\ntotal leukocyte count should prompt concern for infection or crystal-induced disease. However, the presence\nof crystals cannot exclude septic arthritis with certainty.[22] A finding of WBCs greater than 50,000/mm in the\nsetting of trauma suggests infectious arthritis.\nSeptic arthritis typically has 80,000 to 200,000 cells/mL and greater than 75% PMNs on synovial fluid aspirate\nanalysis. Synovial fluid WBC count and percentage of PMN cells from arthrocentesis are the most significant\npredictors of septic arthritis. The likelihood ratio increases as the synovial fluid WBC count increases.\nCounts greater than 50,000/μL have a likelihood ratio of 7.7 (95% confidence interval, 5.7-11.0). Counts greater than\n100,000/μL have a likelihood ratio of 28.0 (95% confidence interval, 12.0-66.0). Finding a PMN cell count of at least\n90% on the same synovial fluid sample suggests septic arthritis with a likelihood ratio of 3.4 (95% confidence\ninterval, 2.8-4.2), while a PMN cell count of less than 90% lowers the likelihood ratio to 0.34 (95% confidence\ninterval, 0.25-0.47).\nOther Labs\nBlood tests that can help determine the etiology of knee effusion include the following: \nLyme titers, especially in the pediatric population with atraumatic unilateral knee effusion [23]\nAntistreptolysin-O for poststreptococcal infection [24]\nRapid plasma reagin for syphilis\nElevated WBC in a complete blood count (CBC) for osteomyelitis, inflammation, or malignancy\nInflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein and sedimentation rate\nAntinuclear antibody for possible autoimmune disorders\nUrine studies help determine the presence of urinary tract infections and sexually transmitted diseases, including\ngonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomonas, which can cause reactive arthritis. Polymerase chain reaction tests of affected\nmucosal sites should also be considered if suspecting gonorrhea and chlamydia. Stool cultures can detect salmonella,\nyersinia, campylobacter, and shigella, which can all cause reactive arthritis.[25]325. 11. 13. 오전  2:27 Knee Effusion - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532279/?report=printable 5/10",

The test\nrequires injecting 155 mL of normal saline in the knee to reach 95% sensitivity.\nTreatment / Management\nPain Control\nAcute pain and swelling warrant individualized treatment. Options include splints, cold or ice packs, partial or non-\nweight-bearing braces, and analgesics like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Drainage may be\neffective if the joint has significant effusion causing pain. If suspecting an infection, the fluid sample should be\nobtained, tested, and cultured before starting antibiotics. Intraarticular steroids should be avoided until infection or\nother contraindications are first ruled out.\nSeptic Joint Treatment\nIntravenous antibiotics should be initiated for suspected infection after sending joint fluid specimens for analysis. The\nmost common bacterial agents causing septic arthritis include staphylococci (40%), streptococci (28%), gram-\nnegative bacilli (19%), mycobacteria (8%), gram-negative cocci (3%), gram-positive bacilli (1%), and anaerobes\n(1%). An orthopedic consult may be necessary. Joint drainage is associated with rapid recovery and low morbidity.\nArthroscopy allows internal joint visualization, adhesiolysis, purulent pocket drainage, and necrotic material\ndebridement.[26]\nManaging Ligamentous Injuries\nA knee brace may be placed on the affected knee as initial treatment. The patient should be given an outpatient\nreferral to an orthopedic surgeon for definitive treatment.

Bacterial invasion can lead to permanent articular cartilage injury. Prosthetic joint infection may result from an\nuntreated local bacterial invasion that has spread to the prosthesis hematogenously.[26]\nDeterrence and Patient Education\nPreventive measures aim to reduce the risk of injury, inflammation, and other factors contributing to the development\nof knee effusions. Patients may be educated on maintaining a healthy weight, strengthening the muscles, improving\nflexibility, and avoiding overuse to protect from osteoarthritis. Using the proper exercise techniques, wearing\nprotective pads, and avoiding risky behaviors prevent traumatic knee injuries. Regular medical consultations and\ntreatment adherence help manage chronic conditions affecting the knees. Staying well-hydrated supports knee joint\nlubrication and cushioning. These measures may not prevent all knee effusion cases but can help minimize the risk of\ndeveloping the condition.\nPearls and Other Issues\nKnee effusion typically presents with swelling, pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion in the affected knee. The\nswelling may be visible and feel fluid-filled or boggy upon palpation. The condition may result from various\nunderlying causes, including trauma, infection, inflammation, and metabolic disorders. Diagnosing knee effusion\ninvolves combining clinical assessment with imaging studies and analysis of the synovial fluid obtained via\narthrocentesis.\nExamination of synovial fluid obtained from the affected knee can provide valuable diagnostic information. Analysis\nincludes evaluating the fluid's appearance, cell count, differential, protein levels, glucose levels, and microbiological\ncultures. The management depends on the underlying cause. Treatments range from noninvasive measures such as\ncold compress application and NSAID intake to intraarticular injections and more invasive surgical interventions.\nUntreated or poorly managed knee effusion can lead to complications such as chronic inflammation, joint stiffness,\ncartilage damage, knee instability, and secondary osteoarthritis.25. 11. 13. 오전  2:27 Knee Effusion - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532279/?report=printable 7/10",

Without proper management, morbidity and mortality from an\nundiagnosed knee effusion may increase.\nWhen the triage nurse identifies an acute knee effusion, the primary care or emergency medicine physician must be\nnotified immediately to determine whether prompt interventions are warranted, as in cases of open fractures and\nseptic arthritis.\nOrthopedic specialists may lend their expertise in managing traumatic cases. Consultation with the pharmacist and\ninfectious disease clinician about the choice and administration of antibiotics can increase efficacy and patient safety.\nRheumatologists may be involved in cases of autoimmune arthritis. If the patient requires any resources for home, the\nsocial worker and case manager should be notified. Knee pain and decreased mobility warrant the services of a\nphysical therapist for early ambulation.\nAll members of the interprofessional team must exercise open communication with the rest of the care team to ensure\noptimal patient outcomes, alert appropriate personnel regarding changes in the patient's condition, and maintain\naccurate records so that everyone involved in the case has updated, precise patient information from which to make\nclinical decisions.\nCommunication among providers is critical to achieving the best result using this shared decision-making model.
