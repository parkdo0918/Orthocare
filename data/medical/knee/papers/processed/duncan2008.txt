Objectives. In radiographic OA (ROA) of the knee, how does radiographic severity and pattern of compartmental involvement influence
symptoms?
Methods. Population-based study of 819 adults aged /C2150 yrs with knee pain. The severity of knee pain and function were measured
using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities scale. Three radiographic views of the knees were obtained.Results. Seven hundred and seventy-seven participants were eligible (mean age 65.5 yrs, 357 males). Higher ROA severity in each of the
tibiofemoral (TF) and patellofemoral (PF) compartments was independently associated with higher mean pain scores (TF: F
2, 700¼9.0,
P<0.0001, PF: F2, 700¼12.7, P<0.0001). The same pattern was found for mean function scores (TF: F2, 705¼7.1, P¼0.001, PF:
F2, 705¼15.9, P<0.0001). If either the TF or PF compartment was affected by moderate/severe OA, the added presence of OA in the other
compartment did not increase the mean pain or function scores.
Conclusions. It is the severity of radiographic disease within a compartment, rather than the distribution of radiographic disease between
compartments that is associated with symptoms. ROA in the PF joint is associated with symptoms, emphasizing the importance ofradiographic changes in his joint.

Introduction
The relationship between radiographic OA (ROA) and symptoms
continues to be debated. In a recent population study, we reporteda consistent cross-sectional relationship between increasing symp-toms and the presence of ROA in a group of individuals with kneepain, when ROA and symptoms were characterized in detail [1].
Having established this relationship, further investigation is
warranted to establish if the degree of ROA is directly related toincreasing symptom severity.
The association between the degree of ROA and the presence of
knee pain has been previously demonstrated in population studies[2–9], as has an association between ROA and disability [10].However, this has not been consistent across all populationstudies [8, 11].
Population studies have frequently limited radiographic data
collection to the tibiofemoral (TF) joint, but establishing whetherspecific compartmental patterns of ROA are associated withdifferent symptoms is important. An association between patello-femoral (PF) OA and pain [9, 12, 13] and disability [12] has beenreported. Szebenyi et al. [14] studied the involvement of different
compartments (i.e. TF or PF) on symptoms and suggested thatknees with structural damage in both compartments were more
likely to be painful and associated with loss of function, compared
with solitary compartmental disease. However, symptomaticunicompartmental OA is common [15]; hence, not only shouldcompartmental involvement be studied but also the level ofradiographic severity within that compartment if the truestructure–symptom relationship is to be determined.
In order to specifically address the question of symptoms
associated with different radiographic patterns, we have specifi-cally studied the relationship between symptom severity and both(i) the degree of ROA and (ii) the compartmental distribution ofROA, using extended radiographic views and detailed symptomquestioning.Methods
The Clinical Assessment Study of the Knee [CAS(K)] is a
prospective observational cohort study of people with knee pain,sampled from the general population. All patients aged /C2150 yrs
registered with three general practices in North Staffordshire, UK,were invited to take part in a two-stage postal survey. Almost allpatients in the United Kingdom are registered with a generalpractitioner, and local registers provide a convenient samplingframework for the open population irrespective of any consulta-tion they have had. Respondents to this survey phase, whoindicated that they had experienced knee pain within the previous12 months, were invited to attend a research clinic for a detailedassessment. This consisted of clinical interview, physical examina-tion, digital photography, plain radiographs, anthropometricmeasurement and a brief self-complete questionnaire. Detaileddescriptions of the study [16], and recruitment and retention ofparticipants [17] have been previously published.
This article reports on cross-sectional analyses of baseline data
from the CAS(K) study. Participants with complete radiographicdata were included in this analysis. Ethical approval was obtainedfrom the North Staffordshire LREC, No 1430, for all phases ofthe study and all participants provided written consent.
Data collection
Clinical data. Data on the severity of knee pain and function
was gathered by self-complete questionnaire. The 24-item WesternOntario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) OA index Likertversion 3.0 [18, 19] was used. Each item has five response options(none, mild, moderate, severe, extreme) and yielded total subscalescores for pain (5 items, total score 0–20) and function (17 items,total score 0–68). BMI was calculated from weight and heightmeasured at the assessment clinic.
Radiographic views. Three views of the knee were obtained: a
weight-bearing posteroanterior (PA) semi-flexed/metatarsopha-langeal view according to the Buckland-Wright protocol [20], askyline and a lateral view. Skyline and lateral views were obtainedwith the participants in a supine position, the knee flexed to 458using a wedge for accuracy. Films were obtained in the radiologydepartment at the local University Hospital NHS Trust, by a team1Arthritis Research Campaign National Primary Care Centre, Primary Care
Sciences, Keele University, Keele, UK.

of six radiographers who had undergone training to standardize
the X-rays and who met for regular quality control sessions.
Radiographic scoring. A single reader (R.D.) scored all study
films blinded to all clinical and questionnaire data. Intraobserver
and interobserver repeatability was assessed in 50 participants(100 knees); the second reader for the interobserver assessment(P.C.) had previous experience of grading knee radiographs.Unweighted /C20-coefficients were calculated. Intraobserver reli-
ability scores for the PA Kellgren and Lawrence (K&L) score,skyline K&L score and lateral osteophytes were very good(unweighted /C20¼0.81–0.98); interobserver scores were good
(/C20¼0.49–0.76).
The TF joint was assessed using the PA view and the posterior
compartment of the lateral view. The PF joint was assessed using
the skyline and lateral views. On the basis of the authors’ original
written description, a K&L grade was assigned to both the PA andskyline views [21]. In the lateral view, superior and inferiorpatellar osteophytes were scored using a standard atlas [22].
Osteophytes on the posterior tibial surface do not appear in the
atlas but were judged on a similar basis of severity as otherosteophytes in the lateral view. Detailed results of the repeat-ability, radiographic scoring and definitions have been previously
published [15].
Radiographic severity of the TF and PF compartments was
defined as mild or moderate/severe according to Table 1. Nine
radiographic subgroups were used to analyse the associationbetween ROA and symptoms (Table 2).
Statistical analysis
Only one knee per individual was analysed, the ‘index knee’. Inparticipants with unilateral knee pain, the index knee was thissingle painful knee. In those with bilateral knee pain, the most
painful knee was the index knee. In situations where participants
thought that both knees were similarly painful, the index knee wasselected at random.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to identify hetero-
geneity of the mean overall WOMAC pain and function scoresbetween the radiographic subgroups, adjusting for age (age 50–59/
60–69/70–79/80 þyrs), gender and BMI (BMI /C2024.9/25–29.2/
/C2130 kg/m
2). The F- and P-values are quoted and the presence of
a linear trend explored. An independent two-sample t-test was
applied when means between two groups were compared.Results
Participants
Over a 14-month period 819 people attended the research clinic, of
whom 777 were eligible for current analysis (420 females and 357
males; mean ( S.D.) age 65.5 (8.7) yrs; BMI ( S.D.) 29.6 (5.2) kg/m2).
Reasons for ineligibility were: patient-declined radiography (2),
incomplete radiographic data [total knee replacement in indexknee (15), unlabelled PA views (2), absent patella (2) and skylineviews deemed uninterpretable (5)] and existing diagnosis of
inflammatory arthritis, verified by medical record review (16).
In all, 531 (68%) participants from the study sample were
classified as having radiographic OA, moderate/severe OA being
present in 307 participants. The distribution of individuals acrossthe nine radiographic subgroups is shown in Table 2.
Association between pain and ROA
Radiographic severity. Radiographic severity was associated
with increasing mean WOMAC pain scores. For OA of the
‘whole’ knee there was heterogeneity of pain scores between
normal, mild and moderate/severe radiographic groups,F
2, 700¼13.8, P<0.0001, the association being strongly linear.
When TF and PF OA were separately analysed, similar trends ofincreasing pain scores with radiographic severity were also seen;
F
2, 700¼9.0,P<0.0001 and F2, 700¼12.7, P<0.0001, respectively
(Table 3).
Compartmental distribution. Variation in mean WOMAC
pain score occurred across the nine radiographic subgroups
(Fig. 1).
No heterogeneity existed between the five groups if moderate/
severe ROA was present in one or more compartments
(F4, 280¼0.97, P¼0.422). Further analysis showed that the
presence of moderate/severe disease in both compartments was
not associated with a higher pain score than moderate/severedisease in one compartment ( t¼1.784, P¼0.075). It appears that

a threshold in pain is reached once moderate/severe radiographic
change is present in either the TF or PF compartment, and the
addition of a second severe compartment does not alter the mean
WOMAC pain score.
In the three groups where only mild ROA occurred, there was
heterogeneity between the mean WOMAC pain score
(F2, 205¼3.6, P¼0.029). Participants with mild isolated PF OA
had a baseline pain score of 6.10 compared with 3.39 for mild
isolated TF OA.
Associations between function and ROA
Radiographic severity. Table 4 shows the relationship
between ROA and functional limitation to be a similar patternto that of pain, mean function scores increasing with radiographicseverity for the ‘whole’ knee and when the TF and PF
compartments were analysed separately.
Compartmental distribution. Mean WOMAC function
scores varied across the nine radiographic subgroups, the highestscore occurring in the radiographic subgroup of isolated severe TF
OA (Fig. 2). Analysis of the five radiographic subgroups where
moderate/severe radiographic OA occurred in either one or both
compartments revealed no heterogeneity ( F
4, 281¼0.9, P¼0.86).
The presence of moderate/severe radiographic OA in bothcompartments was not associated with a higher mean WOMAC
function score than moderate/severe disease in a single compart-
ment ( t¼/C01.398, P¼0.163). It appears, as with pain, that a
threshold effect for function limitation is reached when moderate/
severe radiographic change is present in either of the compartments
and the addition of a second compartment with moderate/severe
ROA does not alter the function score.
In participants with mild radiographic OA only, heterogeneity
was demonstrated between the mean WOMAC function score for
the three mild groups ( F
2, 207¼4.9,P¼0.008). Participants with
mild isolated PF OA had a baseline function score of 20.3compared with 10.0 for mild isolated TF OA.Discussion
Previous research within the CAS(K) cohort has demonstrated arelationship between symptom severity and the presence of ROA
[1]. We have now extended this further, reporting that in a group
of older people with knee pain, both radiographic severity and
compartmental distribution of ROA are significantly associated
with symptom and functional severity.
First, we have reported a relationship between the degree of
radiographic change and the severity of knee pain and functionallimitation. Previous studies have shown that knee pain is morelikely to be present as radiographic severity increases [2–9] but
these studies dichotomized knee pain as present or absent. We
have provided further support to the relationship by demonstrat-ing that radiographic severity is associated with increasing pain
and functional limitation, this linear relationship occurring in OA
of the whole knee joint but also when the TF and PF OA were
studied separately. McAlindon et al. [10] reported an increase in
frequency of disability with worsening ROA, and our results
reinforce his observed relationship in both the TF and PF
compartments. We have not adjusted for pain in our analysis of
disability as we do not believe it to be a true confounder, butinstead it lies on the causal pathway.
Second, although radiographic severity is important, the
compartmental distribution may also influence symptom report-
ing, and our analysis has shown that a simple classification of pain
and function levels is associated with different patterns ofcompartmental OA. Identifying whether ROA occurring in one
compartment results in higher pain or function levels than in the
other is a question of practical importance because of itsimplications for diagnosis and treatment. A further question is
that if both compartments are affected, then is that additionally
linked with pain and function? We found that for moderate/severe
ROA there was no differentiation in pain or function score if
moderate/severe ROA occurred alone or in combination withanother compartment. This suggests that severity is more
important than compartmental involvement. These results are in
contrast with the study reported by Szebenyi et al. [14], who found
that the presence of ROA in both the TF and PF compartments
resulted in significantly higher pain and function scores. However,
in this study radiographic severity was not considered and we
know from previous work within the CAS(K) study (data not
shown) that when TF or PF occur in isolation the disease is milderthan when TF or PF OA occur in combined TF/PF OA. Szebenyi
et al.’s results may reflect underlying severity of ROA rather than
true compartmental involvement. In marked contrast to theCAS(K) study, Szebenyi et al. [14] found isolated TF and PF OA
to be no more symptomatic than in persons with normal knee
radiographs.
When our analysis was restricted to mild radiographic disease,
heterogeneity existed between the three groups. In mild radio-graphic disease, isolated mild PF OA appears to be associated
with higher pain and function scores compared with isolated mild
TF OA in our population study. However, caution needs to beexercised in our cohort because of small numbers in the group
with isolated TF OA ( n¼22).
Third, we report a high prevalence of PF OA in our cohort,
24% of individuals demonstrating isolated PF disease. Previously,McAlindon highlighted the importance of the PF joint and a
recent editorial reemphasized this importance [12, 23] and our
results support this. Notably, we found that even isolated mild PF
OA resulted in significant symptoms and this warrants furtherinvestigation particularly with regard to everyday task-specific
functions. These findings may be relevant to orthopaedic surgeons
when deciding between a unicompartmental and total knee
replacement.
A total of 3106 adults aged /C2150 yrs reporting knee pain in the
previous 12 months were identified from the first baselinequestionnaire, of which 819 attended the research clinic.TABLE4. Adjusted mean overall WOMAC function scores for radiographic severity

There was evidence of selective non-participation during recruit-
ment (aged /C2180 yrs, lower socioeconomic group, currently in
employment, experiencing anxiety or depression, brief episode ofknee pain in the previous year). This did not cause significant biasin either the distribution of WOMAC scores or the associationbetween physical function and obesity. Our current analysisadjusted for age, gender and BMI, and we feel that the selectivenon-participation during recruitment will not substantially bias ourestimates of the association between symptoms and radiographs.
The CAS(K) study did not sample asymptomatic individuals,
and we cannot therefore state how much ROA would be presentin individuals with no knee pain. However, it is the observedassociation between the severity of radiographic knee OA andincreasing pain and functional limitation that is the main
contribution of this article. Another limitation is the small
number of individuals with isolated TF OA. Comparisonsregarding pain and function levels with symptomatic participantswith normal radiographs and isolated TF OA may be biased dueto the small numbers.
The particular strengths of the CAS(K) study are (i) a clearly
defined population, (ii) more radiographic views than in manyprevious studies and detailed scoring of the X-rays and (iii)detailed accounts of pain and function; thus increasing thelikelihood of demonstrating associations if they exist.
This work implies that unicompartmental progression of knee
OA does have consequences for symptoms and function. Oneparticular pattern of progression that may have been under-appreciated is progression of disease within the PF compartment.
Further research is warranted on what effect conservative
treatment may have on disease progression within this jointcompartment. Our findings are cross-sectional and further long-itudinal research would usefully identify the rate of PF progres-sion and its associations with change in pain and function.
In conclusion, the results reported in this article suggest that
structure is still likely to have an important role to play in theprevention of onset and progression of OA, as well as general riskfactors for chronic pain and disability in an ageing population.
