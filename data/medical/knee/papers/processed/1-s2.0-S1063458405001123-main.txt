Summary
Objective : To resolve uncertainty regarding sex differences in osteoarthritis (OA) by performing a meta-analysis of sex differences in OA
prevalence, incidence and severity.
Methods : Standard search strategies for population-based studies of OA providing sex-speciﬁc data. Random effects meta-analysis to provide
pooled male vs female risk and rate ratios for prevalent and incident OA, and standardized mean differences (SMD) for OA severity. Meta-
regression was used to investigate sources of heterogeneity.
Results : Males had a signiﬁcantly reduced risk for prevalent OA in the knee [Risk Ratio (RR) 0.63, 95% CI 0.53 e0.75] and hand [RR 0.81,
95% CI 0.73 e0.90] but not for other sites. Males aged !55 years had a greater risk of prevalent cervical spine OA [RR 1.29, 95% CI
1.18e1.41]. Males also had signiﬁcantly reduced rates of incident OA in the knee [Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) 0.55, 95% CI 0.32 e0.94] and hip
[IRR 0.64, 95% CI 0.48 e0.86], with a trend for hand [IRR 0.65, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 0.35 e1.20]. Females, particularly those R55
years, tended to have more severe OA in the knee but not other sites. Heterogeneity in the estimates of sex differences in prevalence wassubstantially explained by age and other study design factors including method of OA deﬁnition.
Conclusions : The results demonstrate the presence of sex differences in OA prevalence and incidence, with females generally at a higher risk.
Females also tend to have more severe knee OA, particularly after menopausal age. The site differences indicate the need for further studiesto explore mechanisms underlying OA.ª2005 OsteoArthritis Research Society International. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Introduction
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major public health problem due to
its high prevalence, costs, and levels of pain and disability.
Efforts are underway to identify causal mechanisms re-sponsible for the development of OA. While risk factorssuch as age, obesity, injury and genetic proﬁles have been
identiﬁed, the role of sex in OA is unclear
1,2. The study of
sex differences in OA may provide insights into diseasemechanisms in OA. It is reported in the literature that
women have a higher prevalence of knee and certain types
of hand OA than men, particularly after 50 years of age3e5,
whereas the evidence for a sex difference in hip OA isconﬂicting from individual study results. The majority of
studies providing data on sex differences deal with
prevalent OA, with very few examining sex-speciﬁc OA
incidence6e9. Moreover, it is unclear whether any observed
sex difference is due to reporting differences or a truedifference in radiographic OA (ROA) or whether the severity
of OA differs between sexes. The aim of this study therefore
was to use meta-analysis and meta-regression to studysite-speciﬁc sex differences in prevalence, incidence and
severity of OA.
Methods
LITERATURE SEARCH
A MEDLINE search (1966 e2003) was conducted
using the terms ‘‘Sex and OA’’, ‘‘Gender and OA’’ and
‘‘OA prevalence’’, and ‘‘OA incidence’’. References from
retrieved publications were manually checked for anyadditional studies of OA and review articles on OAepidemiology. Reports from the National Center for Health
Statistics (USA) were obtained for data regarding the major
health surveys of chronic diseases including the HealthExamination Survey (HES)
10and the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-I)11. These1Disclaimers dnone.

strategies were supplemented by a further electronic search
for speciﬁc terms linking OA with different joint sites (i.e.,knee, hand, hip and spine). Published studies wereincluded in the meta-analysis if they provided numbers or
rates of males and females affected by OA and were
population-based. Hospital or clinic-based series wereexcluded due to the possibility of selection bias affectingassociations in such studies. One non-English paper was
identiﬁed
12, and was excluded to facilitate data extraction
and quality assessment.
EXTRACTION OF DATA
Two persons (VS, GZ) independently extracted data. In
prevalence studies numbers of males and females with OAand the number in the sample at risk in either sex were
identiﬁed. In studies where only prevalence rates were
reported, numbers with OA in either sex were calculatedbased on reported rates and the sample at risk. When age-
stratiﬁed data were provided, numbers of affected males
and females were extracted according to arbitrary agecategories (age !55 years, age R55 years) based on
previous reports describing variation in sex-speciﬁc risk
3as
well as convenience of assigning age categories in the
included studies. Incidence rates were obtained for malesand females from the included OA incidence studies.Grades of severity stratiﬁed by site were also obtained if
reported.
ASSESSMENT OF QUALITY
Quality of the papers was assessed by one of the study
investigators (TW) independent of data extraction usinga framework modiﬁed from previous work13. Studies were
ranked by a priori characteristics that would be likely to
minimize bias in results. These included: sampling pro-
cedure (0, not stated; 1, non-random; 2, random); sampleresponse rate (0, not stated; 1, !50%; 2,R50%); deﬁnition
of OA (0, self-report; 1, clinical diagnosis; 2, X-ray scale);
use of radiographic atlas (0, no; 1, yes); reporting ofreliability of OA deﬁnition (0, no; 1, yes) with a maximumpossible quality score of 8. The category of clinically
diagnosed OA included mostly studies depending solely
on clinical ﬁndings ( based on clinical joint examination )
14e17,
one study using clinician reported arthritis18and one study
using a combination of X-ray and clinical ﬁndings19.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The Cochrane Review Manager 4.2 software (MetaView,
version 4.2) was used for this meta-analysis. For the meta-
analysis of OA prevalence, the outcome measure was therisk ratio (RR) that refers to the ratio of the prevalence of OAamong males to the prevalence of OA among females. In
prevalent peripheral joint OA, stratiﬁed analyses were
conducted according to pre-speciﬁed variables includingage, OA deﬁnition, ethnicity, sample type (random, non-
random), response rate, and provision of diagnostic
reliability. The few studies where age-stratiﬁed data couldnot be extracted were analyzed in a category termed‘unstratiﬁed’
15,18,20 e23. In spine OA, analyses were per-
formed separately for spine apophyseal OA and spine disc
degeneration (SDD) in both cervical and lumbar regions.Due to the small number of studies on spine disease,stratiﬁed analyses were performed only according to age
categories.For incident OA, the outcome measure was the un-
adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR), which was the ratio ofthe incidence for males relative to females. If this wasunavailable, the ratio of cumulative incidences was used.
The number of incident cases and person-years of follow-up
were provided for both sexes in one study of radiographichand, hip and knee OA allowing computation of incidencerates
8. Similar information could be derived from the data
reported in a medical record-linkage study of symptomatic
radiographic knee and hip OA9. In two studies, sex-speciﬁc
cumulative incidence rates were provided24,25. In one
report, male vs female relative risk (RR) estimates
from a Cox-model were used for the meta-analysis withstandard errors derived from the conﬁdence intervals (CI)provided
7.
For the analysis of sex differences in OA severity, the
outcome measure was the standardized mean difference(SMD) in reported severity grades between males andfemales. In all but one of the studies using radiographs,
grading of severity had been performed using the Standard
Radiographic Atlas of Arthritis
26as OA absent (grade 0),
dubious (grade 1), mild (grade 2), moderate (grade 3) andsevere (grade 4). In these studies, categories of grade 0 or
1 were assigned a score of 0.5, radiographs of grade 2 were
assigned a score of 2, and radiographs of grade 3 or 4 wereassigned a score of 3.5. In one remaining radiographic
study
11in which there had been a subjective grading of
radiographs, we arbitrarily assigned normal/questionableOA a score of 0.5, minimal OA a score of 2, and moderate/severe OA a score of 3.5. In the only study using a clinical
grading
17, we assigned a score of 0.5 to absent/minimal
OA, a score of 2 to moderate OA, and a score of 3.5 tosevere OA. For each study, the mean and standarddeviation of the assigned severity score for males and
females was then computed. The SMD in severity between
males and females for each study was then computed usingstandard methods in the Cochrane Review Manager 4.2
software (MetaView, version 4.2). The formula for SMD is
as follows:
SMDZ/C18
m1i/C255m2i
si/C19/C181/C2553
4Ni/C2559/C19
where mrefers to individual group mean, siis the pooled
standard deviation, and Niis the pooled sample size of the
two groups.
Outcome measures were pooled across studies using
a random effects model which allows for heterogeneity ofeffects between studies28. Tests for homogeneity were
performed, and statistical heterogeneity reported as the
ratio (in percentage) of between-study variation to the totalvariation in effect estimate according to the methoddescribed by Higgins et al.
29. A larger ratio indicates
greater heterogeneity between studies. Publication bias
was examined graphically using a funnel plot of studyprecision (standard error of natural logarithm of risk ratio,lnRR) against effect size (risk ratio) for prevalent peripheral
OA but not spine OA or incident OA given the paucity of
studies in these categories. In the absence of signiﬁcantpublication bias, the funnel plot of study precision vs effect
size should assume a symmetrical funnel shape with the
apex pointing upwards. A deﬁciency in the base of thefunnel with non-symmetry indicates the presence ofpossible publication bias from unpublished small studies.
Weighted random effects meta-regression

different sites (except for sites of spine disease due to small
numbers of studies in this category). The natural logarithmof the RR (lnRR) weighted by inverse variance for eachstudy was regarded as the dependent variable and the
effect of a number of explanatory variables (including age,
OA deﬁnition, ethnicity, sample type, response rate anddiagnostic reliability) was examined. STATA version 8(Stata Corporation, Texas, USA, command ‘metareg’)
27
was used to provide regression coefﬁcients and an iterativeestimate of residual between-study heterogeneity ( t2).
Multivariable models for each OA site were ﬁtted to examine
the independent effect of the explanatory variables using
a step-wise approach, using change in t2as an indicator of
best-ﬁt. Age was not used as a covariate in the multivariableanalysis to avoid duplication of study units from stratiﬁca-
tion. After transformation back to the original ratio scale, the
meta-regression estimate is a ratio of the average RRreported by studies with one characteristic (e.g., radio-graphic deﬁnition) to the average RR reported by studies
with another characteristic (deﬁnition by self-report). Uni-
variable meta-regression was also used to explore hetero-geneity in the analysis of OA severity using age, samplingresponse, reliability of diagnosis and ethnicity as explana-
tory variables. Meta-regression was not attempted for
incidence analysis given the paucity of studies.Results
SEARCH RESULTS
A total of 178 journal articles were screened after the
initial MEDLINE and hand-search. Sixty-eight studies wereidentiﬁed as providing OA prevalence data for males and
females of which 28 were excluded from the analysis (17
hospital-based studies, three colon radiograph-based stud-ies, six studies in highly selected skeletal samples, onehospital register cohort study and one published in
Japanese). Of the remaining 40 population-based stud-
ies
10,11,13 e23,30e55six more were excluded35,41,43,45,46,50.
Reasons for their exclusion were: speciﬁc numbers for
males and females were unavailable from three stud-
ies41,45,46, data overlapped with other included reports in
two studies35,43, and radiographs were obtained only for
a selected sub-sample in one study50. The ﬁnal meta-
analyses for prevalence were performed on 34 studies with
some studies reporting on OA in multiple joint sites.Relevant characteristics of all included studies of OAprevalence are shown in Table I . The search for papers
regarding OA incidence generated nine studies of inter-
est
7e9,24,25,56 e59, of which four hospital-based studies
were excluded56e59. The characteristics of the ﬁve
included incidence studies are shown in Table II .

heterogeneity in the overall pooled male vs female RR
estimates in all categories of OA except cervical spineapophyseal OA for which data were available only in twostudies. This heterogeneity persisted in most subgroup
analyses. Heterogeneity was least for hip OA and became
negligible when hip OA studies were pooled by age andethnicity.
Meta-regression
The magnitude of the male vs female RR varied by age.
Among those R55 years of age, males tended to have
a signiﬁcantly lower pooled risk of knee OA and hand OAcompared to females, with no signiﬁcant sex differencesobserved for any OA, hip OA and spine disease ( Table III ).
Among those !55 years of age, no signiﬁcant sex
differences were observed in pooled risk estimates forperipheral OA categories and any OA ( Table III ). There
appeared to be a greater pooled risk for cervical spine OA in
males among those !55 years of age ( Table IV ), but not for
other sites of spine disease. In univariable meta-regression,age contributed to the variability in lnRR estimates betweenstudies for both knee and hand OA. There was an
estimated relative increase in the RR males vs females of
C0.31 for knee OA ( PZ0.02) and C0.30 for hand OA
(PZ0.04) for younger ( !55 years) compared to older age
(R55 years), the effect of this being to decrease sex
differences in prevalence in those aged !55 years.
Male vs female differences were greater when OA was
deﬁned by other than radiographic methods (i.e., clinical or
self-report) for any, knee and hand OA ( Table II ). Only
radiographic deﬁnition was used in studies of hip OA. Inunivariable meta-regression, there was an increase in RRmales vs females of C0.57 for any OA ( PZ0.01),C1.03
for knee OA ( PZ0.02) and C0.80 (hand OA, P!0.0001)
when OA was deﬁned using only radiographic methodscompared to other methods, the effect of this being to
decrease sex differences in prevalence when a purelyradiographic deﬁnition was used.
Male vs female RRs were lower in predominantly
Caucasian samples compared to non-Caucasian samples
for any OA, hip OA and hand OA, but with very littledifference for knee OA ( Table II ). For other quality
measures, the effects of random vs non-random sample
or adequate response rate ( R50%) vs poor response rate
(!50%) were to cause an increase in the observed male vs
female RRs for any OA and hip OA (in the former) and hip
and hand OA (in the latter). The provision or non-provision
of a reliability estimate for diagnosis did not change RRestimates. In univariable meta-regression, there were nosigniﬁcant associations observed between ethnicity, sample
type, response rate, diagnostic reliability and lnRR. There
was no signiﬁcant effect of overall quality score on lnRR forany OA and other peripheral sites.
With multivariable meta-regression, the associations of
explanatory variables with lnRR varied between OA
categories ( Table V ). No explanatory variables were
signiﬁcantly associated with lnRR for prevalent hip OA(data not shown). For any OA, 70% of between-study
heterogeneity ( t
2reduction from 0.10 to 0.03) could be
explained by the combination of method of OA deﬁnition,adequacy of response rate and ethnicity. These results for
any OA remained unchanged after excluding a study18with
an extremely large sample size ( nZ32,251) from the
analysis. This regression equation gives a predicted malevs female RR of 0.90 for any OA in an ‘‘ideal’’
study (radiographic deﬁnition, response rate O50%) in
a Caucasian population, very similar to the overall pooledestimate of 0.93. For knee OA, the combination of OAdeﬁnition, ethnicity and provision of diagnostic reliability
explained 55% of residual heterogeneity between studies
(t
2reduction from 0.09 to 0.04). From this equation, the

predicted male vs female RR of 0.64 for an ideal study
(radiographic deﬁnition, reliable measurement) in Cauca-sians is very similar to the pooled estimate of 0.63. In hand
OA, 88% of residual between-study heterogeneity ( t2
reduction from 0.08 to 0.01) was explained by the
combination of OA deﬁnition, sample type and adequacy
of response rate. Using this equation, the predicted male vs
female RR for hand OA in an ideal study (radiographicdeﬁnition, random sample, response rate O50%) is 0.87,
similar to the pooled estimate of 0.81.
SEX DIFFERENCE IN INCIDENCE OF OA
The meta-analysis for incident OA is presented in Fig. 3 .
In males, there was a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in the
incidence rate of knee OA (IRR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32 e0.94,
PZ0.03) and hip OA (IRR 0.64, 95% CI 0.48 e0.86,
PZ0.003), and a non-signiﬁcant reduction in the incidence
rate of hand OA (IRR 0.65, 95% CI 0.35 e1.20, PZ0.17).
There was signiﬁcant between-study heterogeneity for kneeand hand OA, but not for hip OA.
Examination of the funnel plots showed that there was
non-symmetry for knee OA, hip OA and hand OA, but not for
any OA ( ﬁg. 1 ). However, there were very few small studiesin most categories. There was a relative paucity of studies
with greater male vs female RRs in knee and hand OA, withthe reverse seen in studies of hip OA.
SEX DIFFERENCES IN SEVERITY OF PREVALENT OA
These results are shown in Fig. 4 . Prevalent knee OA
was signiﬁcantly more severe in females (female vs male
pooled SMD 0.20, 95% CI 0.11 e0.28, P!0.001). These
estimates did not change after excluding the single studywithout radiographic deﬁnition for OA (data not shown)17.
There was no difference between males and females in the
severity of prevalent hip OA (pooled SMD 0.02, 95% CI/C2550.07 to 0.10, PZ0.65) or prevalent hand OA (pooled
SMD /C2550.03, 95% CI /C2550.11 to 0.05, PZ0.43). There was
signiﬁcant heterogeneity between studies in the pooled
analyses for all three categories. In univariable meta-regression, age contributed signiﬁcantly to the variability
in SMDs between studies of knee OA ( bZ0.18, P!0.001)
and hand OA ( bZ0.21, P!0.001) with a trend for hip OA
(bZ/C2550.08, PZ0.08). The effect of age in knee and hand
OA was to increase the male vs female SMDs in people
agedR55 years compared to those aged !55 years
(Fig. 5 ). There were no signiﬁcant effects of sample type,

Discussion
This meta-analysis provides evidence to support sex
differences in prevalent and incident OA that are site-
speciﬁc, with females generally at a higher risk. Heteroge-
neity in sex differences in prevalent OA was substantiallyexplained by age, ethnicity, method of OA deﬁnition and
sampling issues. We also found that females had more
severe radiographic knee OA than males, althoughthere were no signiﬁcant sex differences in severity of hip
and hand OA. Age was a signiﬁcant contributor to the
heterogeneity of effect of sex on severity in knee and handOA, with larger sex differences in people aged R55 years.
There was signiﬁcant risk reduction for knee and hand
OA in males and this was consistent for both prevalence
and incidence meta-analyses. However, the signiﬁcant 36%

risk reduction for incident hip OA in males contrasts with the
lack of a sex difference in prevalent hip OA. Sex differences
in incidence studies are likely to be more reliable as theyare free from the effect of differential survival between
sexes that may be seen in prevalence studies. Although
only two incidence studies of hip OA were available forpooling in the present analysis, the homogeneity of effectbetween these two large studies is also supportive of a true
reduction in incident hip OA risk in males. Both studies were
performed amongst Caucasian people with symptomaticOA, thus limiting conclusions to such populations. More-over, such a sex difference in incident risk of hip OA is
consistent with emerging data in the literature. In a large
clinical sample of patients undergoing urography, femaleswere found to have signiﬁcantly greater decline in joint
space width over a 4-year period
60. In a randomly selected
population-based older cohort, we have found that femalesex was independently associated with lower hip cartilagevolume in a cross-sectional analysis of a population-based
sample of older people
61. Longitudinal studies combining
hip cartilage volume measures and standard radiographicmeasures may provide more deﬁnitive answers in thisregard. Few data are available in the published literature to
explain the sex differences observed in hand OA, with
conﬂicting reports about associations of systemic factorssuch as hormonal status and obesity with hand OA in malesand females
62,63. Given that genetic factors play an
important part in hand OA, it remains to be seen if the
difference between sexes can be explained by interplaybetween genes and systemic/environmental factors. Find-
ings for ‘‘any OA’’ were difﬁcult to interpret because sex
differences may have been masked by the variation in jointsites involved in different studies. In spine disease, theincreased risk in younger males of cervical spine OA
suggests the possibility of trauma as an explanation.
Heterogeneity between studies remained an important
factor limiting the interpretation of our results for prevalentand incident OA. We were able to explore potential reasons
for such heterogeneity for the former, but not the latter. We
found that sex differences in knee and hand OA varied withage, such that prevalence was greater in females R55
years of age. The reasons for this site and age speciﬁcity
are largely unknown but suggest an effect of the meno-pause
64, reﬂecting the effect of estrogen deﬁciency in
earlier life. In a recent report, the sex difference in kneecartilage volume became greater after 50 years of age,
suggesting a possible hormonal mediator of the sex
difference and indicating the need for further research inthis area65. Although estrogen may have a modulating
effect on cartilage, the effects of sex hormones and growth
factors in mediating such an age esex interaction in OA risk
are poorly understood2,64. We also speculate that the
variation of such sex differences by age may also reﬂect the
effect of trauma in earlier life in males although this remains
to be explored further.
Apart from age, univariable meta-regression showed that
method of OA deﬁnition also explained a substantial
amount of the variation between studies of prevalent OA.
The use of radiographic methods to deﬁne OA appeared todecrease the difference between sexes compared to self-
report or clinical methods. Non-radiographic methods based
on pain or other symptoms may result in over-diagnosis ofOA. Female sex has been shown to be associated withhand pain after adjusting for age and radiographic scores
for hand OA
66. Women may be more likely to self-report
OA. Greater pain levels in women may be mediated byspeciﬁc forms of behaviour67that could lead to higher levels
of self-report. Therefore, the use of non-radiographic
methods may tend to exaggerate sex differences in
prevalence due to reporting bias. Multivariable modelingshowed that measures of study quality such as nature ofsample, response rates and reliability, in variable combina-
tions with deﬁnition and ethnicity, also explained some of the
heterogeneity between studies of any, knee and hand OA.After accounting for such heterogeneity in the multivariable
model, the predicted male vs female RRs for these
categories were almost the same as the overall unadjustedpooled estimates. When combined with the small variation inrisk ratios between the individual studies, this suggests that
the observed degree of statistical heterogeneity between
studies may to some extent be explained by the largesamples in each category, and that the pooled estimatesmay be a reasonable reﬂection of the true sex differences.
Females had more severe radiographic knee OA than
males, but no signiﬁcant differences were found betweensexes in the severity of hip and hand OA. These ﬁndings
must be interpreted again in the light of heterogeneity
between studies. We found that age may importantlycontribute to heterogeneity in these analyses with sexdifferences being more pronounced in people aged R55-1.00-0.500.000.501.00

years, this effect being consistent for knee and hand OA.
Other variables such as body mass index, physical activity,hormonal changes and bone factors may also explain thisheterogeneity. In knee OA, heterogeneity cannot be
explained by the method of OA diagnosis (self-report vs
radiographic diagnosis) because the exclusion of the solestudy without radiographic diagnosis did not change theresults. Similarly, it is unlikely that the method of grading of
severity is responsible for variability in effect between
studies. Severity in almost all studies was graded using thestandard Kellgren and Lawrence scale, which is weighted
more towards the presence of osteophytes. It is possible,
however, that different results may be obtained witha method of grading that is less dependent on the presenceof osteophytes and more on the degree of joint space
narrowing
68. Heterogeneity may have also masked any sex
differences in the severity of hip and hand OA, and thus wemay be limited in our ability to draw ﬁrm conclusions in thisregard.
The inclusion of only population-based studies, in-
dependent double data extraction and a priori speciﬁcation
of quality criteria are strengths of this meta-analysis.However, the possibility of publication bias is a potential
limitation. Funnel plot asymmetry appeared to exist for
the analyses of prevalent knee, hip and hand OA,indicating potential publication bias. It is difﬁcult to
conclude publication bias in the presence of heterogeneity
of effect. However, if present, such bias may arise from theexclusion of smaller unpublished studies or non-Englishstudies from the analysis. Such a bias may not be
important in the case of hip OA, given that the overall
pooled result is towards the null. In the case of knee andhand OA, the effect of publication bias is that male vsfemale differences found in our analysis may be slight
overestimates, and the effect of inclusion of any un-
published small studies may be to slightly attenuate but isunlikely to abolish the sex differences due to the large
samples included.
In conclusion, we provide meta-analytic evidence for
a greater risk in females for prevalent and incident knee andhand OA and incident hip OA. No signiﬁcant sex differences
were observed for prevalent hip OA. We also found a higher
risk for prevalent cervical spine degeneration in males aged!55 years. Females also tended to have more severe knee
OA than males. Sex differences in severity were stronger
among people aged R55 years. Thus, there is some basis
for further exploration of factors responsible for sex differ-ences in peripheral joint sites and possibly in the cervical
spine. Further studies into these sex differences have the
potential to increase understanding mechanisms underlyingthis common disease.
