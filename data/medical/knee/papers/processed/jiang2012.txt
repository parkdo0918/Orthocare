Objective: Excess bodyweight, expressed as increased body mass index, is associated with osteoarthritis
risk, especially in weight bearing joints. However, the strength of the association was inconsistent. Thestudy was conducted to quantitatively assess the association between body mass index and the riskof knee osteoarthritis and investigate the difference of the strength stratiﬁed by sex, study type andosteoarthritis deﬁnition.Methods: We used published guidelines of the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
Group (MOOSE) to perform the meta-analysis. The search strategy employed included computerizedbibliographic searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochran Library and references of publishedmanuscripts. Study-speciﬁc incremental estimates were standardized to determine the risk of kneeosteoarthritis associated with a 5 kg/m
2increase in BMI.
Results: Twenty-one studies were included in the study. The results showed that body mass index was
signiﬁcantly positive associated with osteoarthritis risk in knee site. A 5-unit increase in body mass indexwas associated with an 35% increased risk of knee osteoarthritis (RR: 1.35; 95%CI: 1.21, 1.51). Magnitudeof the association was signiﬁcantly stronger in women than that in men with signiﬁcant difference (men,RR: 1.22; 95%CI: 1.19, 1.25; women, RR: 1.38; 95%CI: 1.23, 1.54; p= 0.04). The summary effect size was
1.25(95%CI: 1.18, 1.32) in case-control studies and 1.37 (95%CI: 1.19, 1.56) in cohort studies ( p= 0.28).
Body mass index was positively associated with knee osteoarthritis deﬁned by radiography and/or clinicalsymptom (RR: 1.25, 95%CI: 1.17, 1.35) and clinical surgery (RR: 1.54, 95%CI: 1.29, 1.83). The latter tendedto be stronger than the former ( p< 0.01).
Conclusion: Increased body mass index contribute to a substantially increased risk of knee OA. The
magnitude of the association varies by sex and OA deﬁnition.

1. Introduction
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease and is
one of the most prevalent symptomatic health problems for olderindividuals. The etiology of OA is multifactorial, including inﬂam-matory factors, metabolic factors, and mechanical factors [1].O A
have incurred substantial disease burden and inﬂuenced the qualityof daily life for the elderly. Knee joint is the most clinically affectedsite, and knee OA is the main indication for a large number of kneereplacement surgeries performed annually [2].

1Tel: +86-0451-87502870; Fax: +86-0451-87502881.Obesity has become a global problem leading to excess morbid-
ity and mortality. According to the latest World Health Organization(WHO) report, more than 1.6 billion adults (aged 15 years old)are overweight [3]. Obesity has drawn interest in recent studies
because of its modiﬁable status and its association with OA. There isconsiderable evidence indicating that obesity plausibly representsone of the most important risk factors for particular peripheral jointsites, predominantly the knee site and the hip site [4–11] .
Standard therapeutic modalities can alleviate symptoms and
improve function but cannot alter the disease process [10] .
Therefore, much attention has been invested in improving therecognition of epidemiology and in elucidating possible factors pre-disposing to OA development. Mechanical stress resulting from ahigh body mass index (BMI) is known to be a risk factor for thedevelopment of knee OA, and better understanding of the positiveeffect of obesity on OA development is likely to be valuable in the

campaign against osteoarthritis. To our knowledge, many epidemi-
ologic studies have been performed to investigate the associationbetween obesity with knee OA, and obesity is an unequivocal riskfactor for the onset and progression of knee OA [9,12,13] . However,
the link between obesity and the risk of knee OA lack quantitativelyassessment.
It is probable that once sufﬁcient information is provided
through systematic studies, we will be able to obtain a better under-standing of the cause of OA as a whole and perhaps develop newinterventions to lower the prevalence of obesity and knee OA inthe future. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis and meta-regression to quantitatively clarify the association between BMI,as a measure of overall obesity, and the risk of developing knee OAbased on available studies to date.
2. Methods
2.1. Search strategy and inclusion criteria
The search strategy included computerized bibliographic
searches of PubMed (1966–2010), EMBASE (1974–2010) and refer-ences of published manuscripts. The Cochrane Library of SystematicReviews also was queried. Other websites searched includedNational Institute for Clinical Excellence, National ElectronicLibrary for Health- musculoskeletal specialist library, ArthritisResearch Campaign, Arthritis Care, Arthritis and MusculoskeletalAlliance, and Arthritis Foundation National Ofﬁce. The search termsincluded obesity, overweight, BMI, adiposity, arthritis, osteoarthri-tis and OA. Studies in humans of the association between BMI andknee OA were included if they met the following criteria:
•the study was English-language articles;
•the study was of a cohort, or a (nested) case-control study
reported the association with corresponding conﬁdence intervals(95%CI) for at least three categories of exposure (BMI), or mustprovide sufﬁcient data to estimate them. Height and weight orBMI must be provided in those studies;
•the study was on primary or idiopathic knee OA, while not sec-
ondary OA
•the study was on the relationship between obesity and knee joint
replacements.
No speciﬁc limits of ethnicity, the type of knee OA (femoro-
tibial and patello-femoral OA), and the site of knee OA (unilateralor bilateral knee OA) were set.
The titles and abstracts were scanned to exclude studies that
were clearly irrelevant. The full texts of the remaining articles wereread to determine whether they contained information about ourinterest. In addition, the electronic searches were supplementedby scanning reference lists from retrieved articles to identify addi-tional studies. For studies with same population resources orover-lapping datasets, the most complete one was included. Theexcluded studies included reviews, conference abstracts, letters toeditors and studies on the progression of OA.
2.2. Data extraction and quality assessment
Data were extracted using a standardized data extraction form
and the information of studies was assessed by two investigatorsindependently. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion andrepeated examination of the included articles The following infor-mation was used for each study: The ﬁrst author’s name, year ofpublication, country where the study was performed, participantpopulation, study design, OA deﬁnition/assessment, risk estimateswith corresponding 95%CI either with one BMI category as thereference or expressed as a slope per incremental BMI, covariates
controlled in the study.
For measuring quality of observational studies no universal scale
was available, therefore, we followed the guidelines of the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) groupand assessed the quality of the included studies based on the fol-lowing criteria [14] :
•clear description of the population and setting;
•sufﬁcient sample size;
•appropriate measurement of outcomes;
•response rate of the original study was higher than 80%;
•completeness of follow-up or questionnaires;
•appropriate consideration and adjustment for potential con-
founders;
•knee OA was assessed identical in studied population;
•exposure was measured identical for cases and controls;
•information on completers vs. withdrawals;
•exact statistical and analytical methods.
Throughout this assessment, when information about a speciﬁc
item was consistent with the criteria, it was scored as “1”; other-wise, it was scored as “0”. Studies that fulﬁlled more than eightcriteria were considered high quality (i.e., scored ≥8).
2.3. Statistical analysis
Meta-analysis was performed for each individual study using
Stata 8.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX). Brieﬂy, the analysissoftware produced forrest plots as a schematic description of themeta-analysis results. Summary random effect estimates werereported using pooled odds ratios (OR), and 95% conﬁdence inter-vals (CI) that were calculated around each summary effect estimate.The random effect model assumed that included study was a ran-dom sample of a hypothetical population of study.
Study-speciﬁc OR and corresponding 95%CI was chosen rather
than weight to explore the association because of the wide variationin average weight and height across races. The cut-off for expo-sure categories varied between studies included in the study. Inorder to keep all studies on a coincident scale, category-speciﬁc riskwas transformed into risk estimates associated with per 5 kg/m
2
increments in BMI for each study instead of per 1 kg/m2incre-
ment, which would be impractical and non-signiﬁcant. Therefore,for practical reasons per 5 kg/m
2increments in BMI has been used
as a surrogate for the change of bodyweight. These estimates werecalculated on the assumption of a linear trend between the naturallogarithm of OR and increased BMI for different exposure cate-gory [15] . Scaled OR was estimated using the method described
by Greenland [16] . As most studies have reported effect size and
their corresponding 95%CI, we used these data as summary statis-tics for each study. The value assigned to each BMI category was themid-point for closed categories. For open-ended categories (e.g.,BMI > 30), we estimated the median (assuming a normal distri-bution for BMI) [17] . Unless special statement, the adjusted risk
estimate from each study was used.
Heterogeneity testing using Q statistics was performed to eval-
uate variance between studies [18] . If the between-study variance
was large enough to make the test of heterogeneity signiﬁcant(P< 0.05), random effects models were considered most appropri-
ate. As these tests of heterogeneity were relatively insensitive, amore conservative P-value of less than 0.10 was used. Finally, the
potential publication bias was examined with funnel plots, whichplot the log of effect sizes against the inverse standard error of theeffect size. The Egger’s regression test was used to test funnel plotasymmetry [19] .A P-value < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant for
publication bias. We also conducted sensitivity analysis omitting

each study to assess whether result was inﬂuenced excessively by
a single study [20] .
3. Results
3.1. Studies included in the meta-analysis
The primary literature search had identiﬁed 414 potentially
relevant studies. After review of these titles and abstracts, weretrieved full articles for further assessment. A total of 44 stud-ies have been identiﬁed. Twenty-three studies were excluded forunavailable or incomplete data [7,21–42] . Finally, 21 unique studies
were available for this meta-analysis, including 15 cohort studies[9,11–13,43–53] and six case-control studies [54–59] . The number
of included studies whose deﬁnition of OA was based on clinicalsurgery was six studies [13,46,50,55,57,59] , on radiography seven
studies [11,12,45,48,51,53,58] , on radiography and clinical symp-
tom six studies [9,43,44,52,54,56] , and on self-reported two studies
[47,49] .Fig. 1 shows the search and selection process. Table 1 sum-
marizes the characteristics of included studies.
3.2. Meta-analysis of increased BMI and the risk of knee OA
The analysis involved 872 717 subjects from 18 studies. A sum-
mary of meta-analysis for the association between obesity andsusceptibility to knee OA was shown in Fig. 2 . A 5-unit increase
in BMI was signiﬁcantly related to an increased risk of knee OA(RR: 1.35; 95%CI: 1.21, 1.51; P< 0.001 for Q test; I
2= 99.20% for het-
erogeneity). This suggested that every 5-unit increase in BMI wasassociated with a 35% increased risk of knee OA.
We also carried subgroup analysis to examine whether the
association was different because of stratiﬁcation by sex, studydesign and deﬁnition of knee OA. For different sex, the associa-tion was 1.38(95% CI: 1.23–1.54; P< 0.001 for Q test; I
2= 97.00%
for heterogeneity) in women and 1.22 (95%CI: 1.19, 1.25; P= 0.71

for Q test; I2< 0.001% for heterogeneity) in men with sig-
niﬁcant difference ( P= 0.04) ( Table 2 ). Examined case-control
studies and cohort studies separately, we found that the sum-mary association was 1.25(95%CI: 1.18, 1.32; P= 0.15 for Q test;
I
2= 44.40% for heterogeneity) in case-control studies and 1.37
(95%CI: 1.19, 1.56; P< 0.001 for Q test; I2= 99.40% for heterogeneity)
in cohort studies with no statistical signiﬁcant difference ( P= 0.28)
(Table 2 ). To assess the association in more details, we further
conducted the analysis according to the deﬁnition of OA (clin-ical surgery versus clinical symptom or radiography or clinicalsymptom + radiography). The end-point was precisely categorizedinto non-clinical surgery (radiography and/or clinical symptom)and clinical surgery. The association was 1.25(95%CI: 1.17, 1.35;P< 0.001 for Q test; I
2= 93.20% for heterogeneity) deﬁned by radiog-
raphy and/or clinical symptom and 1.54(95%CI: 1.29, 1.83; P< 0.001
for Q test; I2= 98.60% for heterogeneity) deﬁned by clinical surgery,
respectively. The latter tended to give larger effect than the former(P< 0.01) ( Table 2 ).
3.3. Heterogeneity and publication bias
Signiﬁcant heterogeneity between studies was noted in cohort
studies, while moderate heterogeneity in case-control studies. Itwas difﬁcult to correlate the funnel plot, which is usually used todetect publication bias, because the number of studies included inthe analysis was relatively small. No publication bias was detectedby Egger’s regression ( P= 0.95), but Begger methods had tested
bias opposing to Egger’s regression ( P= 0.03). Trim and ﬁll anal-
ysis showed no study might have been missing. Inﬂuence analysisproduced similar summary risk estimates and did not affect thestrength of evidence for increased BMI and the risk of knee OA.
4. Discussion
The meta-analysis shows that the risk of knee OA increase with
BMI and a dose-response relationship exist. A 5-unit increase inBMI is signiﬁcantly associated with an increased risk of developingknee OA (RR: 1.35; 95%CI: 1.21, 1.51). That is, every 5-unit increasein BMI is associated with a 35% increased risk of knee OA. Our ﬁnd-ings support the notion that there is a positive association betweenincreased BMI and the risk of knee OA. Meanwhile, our results pro-vide a quantitative risk estimates and a continuous scale that is areliably steady result. BMI is analyzed on the continuous scale, and

effect size is converted to be per ﬁve units to reﬂect both over-
weight BMI of 27 against normal BMI of 22 and obese BMI of 32against overweight BMI of 27. It is also possible that any point ofcategories for BMI among normal distribution of population caninterpret the increased risk of knee OA. And, the magnitude of theassociation was slightly stronger in women than men with signif-icant difference in our meta-analysis. A meta-analysis evaluateddata on the relationship between obesity and the risk of knee OA[60] . However, the report provided no obvious evidence as a contin-
uous scale for risk estimates of knee OA. Compared to Blagojevic’spublished meta-analysis on observational studies, we used strictdiagnostic criteria for knee OA in order to determine true asso-ciation between the exposure and the outcome, and provided anobvious evidence of dose-response relationship as a continuousscale.
Meta-analysis of observational studies are prone to bias, and
confounding factors that are inherent in original studies broughtabout different extent of bias. Case control studies are more proneto recall bias such as recalling BMI. In case-control studies patientswith symptomatic knee OA might exaggerate the risk of developingOA associated with prior weight because they are more likely tooverestimate earlier body weight. We thus restricted our analysisto cohort studies and case control studies separately. However, themagnitude of the association remained similar after being stratiﬁedby different study type. This indicated that there was few recallbias.
OA is generally diagnosed by radiography and clinical symp-
tom. Radiographic OA is deﬁned by X-ray based on traditionalcriteria of Kellgren-Lawrence scales (graded 0–4, where 0 = none;1 = possible osteophytes only; 2 = deﬁnite osteophytes and possiblejoint space narrowing; 3 = moderate osteophytes and/or deﬁnitejoint space narrowing; and 4 = large osteophytes, severe joint spacenarrowing, and/or bony sclerosis). Clinical OA (Symptomatic OA) isdiagnosed on the basis of disease histories, symptoms and clini-cal ﬁndings according to standard criteria evaluated by speciallytrained physicians. The validity of study depends on the accu-racy of case deﬁnition, which may be one of the reasons thatrisk estimates are different across studies. In fact, OA is difﬁ-cult to assess because it combines both symptoms and pathologicchanges, the latter is usually recognized by radiography. Radiologi-cal grounds probably mean more sensitivity and include mild cases,whereas joint replacement surgery indicates severe end-stage OA.Some papers involved in the study have reported the associationbased on different OA deﬁnition. More and larger studies thatreport BMI-OA risk associations separately for OA deﬁnition areanticipated.
We found signiﬁcant heterogeneity in our meta-analysis,
whereas it did not reduce substantially in cohort studies and casecontrol studies after subgroup was conducted. This may be becauseof the variations in OA deﬁnition, different population, diverse con-founders, the irregularities of category-speciﬁc information and theway of BMI report. Begg methods considered that this test had
larger test performance when the number of involved studies weremore than 75, while moderate ability when 25 studies. Egger et al.used linear regression method to detect the symmetry of funnelplot, and its statistics performance was higher than Begg methods.So we used trimming and ﬁlling analysis to further evaluate publi-cation bias. Comprehension of trimming and ﬁlling result did not liein how many studies should be included, and the result remainedsimilar after being adjusted by trimming and ﬁlling analysis. Inﬂu-ence analysis suggested that no single studies affected signiﬁcantlythe summary estimate.
There are some limitations considered in this study. First, smok-
ing seems to be a major potential confounder [29] . However, we
could not determine the effect of smoking because few studies werestratiﬁed by smoking status. Second, radiographic OA cases basedon traditional criteria using Kellgren-Lawrence scales are generallydeﬁned. Alternative classiﬁcation scales for OA have been used [11] .
Studies using both the traditional Kellgren-Lawrence and newermodiﬁed individual scales might account for the variation. Third,speciﬁc occupational groups whose jobs requiring repetitious tasksshow high predisposition to developing OA in repetitively usedjoints [25,39] . BMI, deﬁned by anthropometric measures or self-
reported, may contribute to different results. All these could beadditional bias and need further research. Finally, some impor-tant confounders have not been measured with sufﬁcient precision,or have not been measured at all in original studies. Since BMIseemed to predict slightly stronger for bilateral OA than unilat-eral OA [43] . The positive association of BMI with bilateral knee
OA was even more obvious. Unfortunately, few studies analyzedsuch a differentiation [43] . We could not rule out the possibility
of those potential confounders and brought about heterogene-ity. In addition, anthropometric measures other than BMI, suchas waist-to-hip ratio and waist circumference, also serve as bettermeasures of adiposity. However, few studies provided such infor-mation to permit comprehensive analysis of associations acrossstudies.
WHO endorses the use of BMI (kilogram per square
meter) to deﬁne obesity as BMI ≥30 kg/m
2and overweight as
BMI≥25 kg/m2. Anthropometric measurement or self-reported of
BMI at baseline could not represent that of changes during follow-up. If BMI is generally obtained from the baseline year, the analysesdo not allow for that a large period of time have elapsed betweenthe ascertainment of exposure and the development of outcome.However, fewer articles reported the association between BMI ear-lier in life and the risk of OA in the life course [58] . Moreover, the
prevalence of OA increases with age, which is further aggravated byobesity. Risk estimates assessed by BMI at age 18 years were signif-icantly greater than that by “recent” BMI. Crucial questions remainunresolved about the cumulative effect of excess bodyweight overseveral decades, the effect of key weight-change periods in the lifecourse of individuals, and interactions with other potential riskfactors.
Although with some limitations, our meta-analysis provides an
obvious evidence of dose-response relationship as a continuousscale for the association between increased BMI with the risk ofdeveloping knee OA. We have transformed category-speciﬁc riskestimates into a quantitative risk estimate associated with every5 kg/m
2increase in BMI. Most importantly, we have modeled a
5 kg/m2increase in BMI, and the result may be considerably prac-
tical and theoretically important. Obesity is particularly importantfor developing OA in weight-bearing joints, and modifying obesitycan prevent osteoarthritis-related pain and disability. The ﬁnd-ing further supports the signiﬁcance of obesity in the etiology ofosteoarthritis. The prevention of obesity is important, as it hasadverse effects on health. Also, change of body weight is useful andfeasible.
