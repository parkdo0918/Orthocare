Objectives: To (1) document pain location in medial tibiofemoral osteoarthritis (OA) using the patient-
administered Photographic Knee Pain Map (PKPM); (2) compare pain severity, nature and likelihoodof neuropathic-like symptoms, physical dysfunction and presence of symptoms at other sites across the
most common pain patterns.
Design: Baseline data were analysed from 164 participants with medial tibiofemoral OA (TFJOA)
participating in a randomised controlled trial (RCT). Participants completed the PKPM indicating allrelevant pain zones of their most painful knee. Pain zones were collapsed into regions to determine
patterns of pain. Symptoms were quanti ﬁed using numeric rating scales (NRSs) of pain severity, Western
Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Intermittent and Constant Osteoar-thritis Pain (ICOAP) and painDETECT questionnaires. Symptoms at other joints were categorised as
present/absent.
Results: The medial joint line ( n¼123, 75%), patellar tendon ( n¼62, 38%) and posterior knee ( n¼61,
37%) were the most frequently reported pain zones. The most frequent patterns were diffuse (41%),
isolated medial (16%), anterior-medial (12%) and medial-posterior (11%) pain. WOMAC and ICOAP scores
were higher in the diffuse compared to anterior-medial patterns. Mean PainDETECT scores were higherwith both diffuse and medial-posterior pain relative to anterior-medial pain.Conclusion: Only 16% of the cohort indicated isolated medial knee pain, whilst a diffuse pain pattern was
most common. People with diffuse knee pain reported more severe pain and physical dysfunction than
those with anterior-medial pain. Prevalence of possible/likely neuropathic-like symptoms tended to bemore frequent in diffuse and posterior-medial patterns compared to anterior-medial pain.

Introduction
Knee pain is the most debilitating symptom of knee osteoar-
thritis (OA)1e3. Its aetiology is complex and clinical presentation
heterogeneous2e4. For clinicians, pain location is a standard
component of assessment to assist diagnosis of a clinical problem
and to guide decision-making regarding the most appropriate
treatment course. For researchers, pain location may be used as aselection criterion for a given study (e.g., medial knee pain to in-
crease likelihood of recruiting those with medial tibiofemoral OA
(TFJOA))5e8. Despite the plethora of research evaluating pain ex-
periences associated with knee OA, there are relatively few studies
evaluating location of pain2,9e11.
Typically, location of knee pain has been ascertained using
interviewer-administered proxy knee representations where the
interviewer maps painful sites onto a diagram after the patient had
described and/or pointed to the location(s) of pain2,3,9,11 e14.
Administrative burden aside, interviewer-mapped assessments
may have limited accuracy because of interviewer errors and/or
recall or coding bias15. Additionally, numerous diagrammatic knee
representations have been used, which have not been validated
and/or evaluated for reliability2,9e11,14. Although previous studies
suggest that the anterior-medial and/or medial knee is a common*Address correspondence and reprint requests to: A. Van Ginckel, Alan Gilbert

site of pain in mixed compartmental knee OA2,9e11, discrepancies in
the literature remain as to whether pain is typically local in nature
or more generalized2,3,9,10. Pain location appears to impact severity
of pain and physical dysfunction in knee OA, as poorer clinical
outcomes have been reported with more generalized pain pat-
terns3,9,10. However the current literature is limited by the use of
interviewer-dependent methods, and/or knee diagrams that fail to
represent the entire knee. Furthermore, previous research on pain
location in knee OA is largely limited to heterogeneous samples
(including chronic knee pain patients with or without radiographic
OA) rendering resulting patterns dif ﬁcult to interpret and apply to
clinical practice and/or research. Given that medial TFJOA is a
common pattern of OA16, research evaluating pain location in
people with de ﬁnite evidence of medial TFJOA is warranted.
Further, no study in knee OA has evaluated relationships between
pain location and neuropathic-like symptoms.
The Photographic Knee Pain Map (PKPM) was developed to
overcome limitations of previous methods15. The PKPM provides a
photographic representation of both knees. The patients them-
selves indicate pain locations in their knees by marking the relevant
areas on the photographs with small crosses. Subsequently, re-searchers use a transparency template to overlay on the photo-
graphs mapping painful areas to distinct knee zones. This template
identi ﬁes 10 zones with margins based on anatomic boundaries
15.
This patient-administered instrument has generally good to very
good intra-rater and inter-rater reliability, and has demonstrated
convergent validity against an interviewer-administered knee pain
map2in patients with knee pathology15. Although the PKPM has
been applied in a cross-sectional sample undergoing arthroscopy
for a range of knee pathologies17, it has not been used to identify
pain location in knee OA.
The aims of this study were two-fold. Firstly, we aimed to
describe locations and patterns of knee pain in people with radio-
graphic medial TFJOA using the patient-administered PKPM. Sec-
ondly, we aimed to compare the differences in knee pain (severity,
nature (intermittent or constant) and quality (possible/likely
neuropathic-like symptoms)), physical dysfunction and presence of
symptoms at other sites across the most common patterns of pain
location to determine whether pain location is associated with
clinical symptoms.
Materials and methods
This cross-sectional analysis utilized baseline data of an ongoing
randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the effects of
unloading shoes in medial TFJOA18. Data for this cross-sectional
study were collected at baseline in the RCT, prior to randomization.
Participants
Data from 164 participants with medial TFJOA enrolled in the
RCT were used. Participants were recruited from the community via
advertisements in social and print media, radio and television and
our volunteer database. Medial TFJOA was classi ﬁed according to
American College of Rheumatology criteria19. Inclusion criteria
were: (1) aged /C2150 years; (2) knee pain on most days of the past
month; (3) average pain score of /C214 on an 11-point numerical
rating scale (Numeric rating scale (NRS), terminal descriptors ‘no
pain ’and ‘worst pain possible ’) in the past week; (4) de ﬁnite X-ray
evidence of OA (Kellgren eLawrence (KL) /C21grade 2)20; and (5)
deﬁnite X-ray evidence of medial TFJOA (at least grade 1 medial
osteophytes and medial /C21lateral osteophytes, and at least grade 1
medial joint space narrowing (JSN) and medial >lateral JSN) using a
radiographic atlas21). Major exclusion criteria included: (1) intra-
articular corticosteroid injections or knee surgery to either knee(past 3 months); (2) history of knee joint replacement or high tibial
osteotomy; (3) systemic arthritic conditions; (4) any other
muscular, joint or neurological condition affecting lower limb
function; (5) a body mass index (BMI) /C2136 kg/m2(due to dif ﬁ-
culties in three-dimensional gait analysis in the RCT) and/or; (6)
ankle/foot pathology or pain that was either perceived as worse
than knee pain and/or required treatment in the past 6 months18.
For bilaterally eligible knees, only the most symptomatic knee
was evaluated. If both knees were rated as equally painful, the right
knee was evaluated. Ethics approval was obtained from The Uni-
versity's Human Research Ethics Committee. All participants pro-
vided written informed consent.
Radiographic evaluation
Radiographic severity of TFJOA was assessed from semi ﬂexed
posteroanterior weightbearing X-rays. The KL grade20was used to
rate overall severity of TFJOA, where grade 2 ¼deﬁnite osteophytes
and possible JSN, grade 3 ¼moderate multiple osteophytes, de ﬁ-
nite JSN and possible bone deformity and grade 4 ¼large osteo-
phytes, marked JSN, severe sclerosis and de ﬁnite bone deformity20.
A radiographic atlas21was used to rate medial and lateral tibiofe-
moral JSN and each of medial and lateral tibial and femoral osteo-
phytes (Grade 0 ¼normal, Grade 1 ¼mild, Grade 2 ¼moderate,
Grade 3 ¼severe). Radiographs were evaluated by the same
musculoskeletal researcher with >10 years of experience in grading
radiographic knee OA (RSH). In our laboratory, we have previously
reported intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of KL grades
(weighted kappa) of 0.83 e0.87 and 0.87, respectively22.
Descriptive characteristics
Demographics were collected by questionnaire and included
age, gender, duration of symptoms and previous knee surgery.
Height and weight were measured to calculate BMI.
Knee pain location
The PKPM was used to determine location of knee pain15. Par-
ticipants marked all pain locations in their most symptomatic
eligible knee using small crosses upon a paper copy of a photo-
graphic representation of the anterior view of a pair of knees
(Fig. 1 ). Additionally, a tick box below the photograph enabled
participants to report pain in the posterior knee (as present or
absent). Subsequently, a template transparency dividing the knee
into nine anterior zones based upon anatomic landmarks (lateral
and medial joint line areas, superior lateral and medial zone,
quadriceps tendon, lateral and medial patella, patella tendon and
tibia) was overlaid on the photograph [ Fig. 2(A) ]. For each zone,
pain was recorded as present if one or more marks were located in
the zone as per the bordering lines on the transparency. Marks
located on bordering lines indicated pain in both adjacent zones.
Thus, for each participant, pain was recorded as either present or
absent in each of the 10 zones (nine anterior and one posterior
zone)15,17.
Clinical symptoms
The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis
Index (WOMAC) was administered to assess pain and physical
function during daily tasks using the respective subscales. The pain
subscale has ﬁve items with a ﬁve-point Likert response scale ( ‘no
pain ’(score 0) to ‘severe pain ’(score 4)) and giving a maximum
score of 20. The physical function subscale has 17 items with a ﬁve-
point Likert response scale ( ‘no physical dysfunction ’(score 0) toA. Van Ginckel et al. / Osteoarthritis and Cartilage 24 (2016) 1135 e1142 1136

‘severe physical dysfunction ’(score 4)) and giving a maximum
score of 68. Moderate to excellent test eretest reliability and in-
ternal consistency have been reported in OA23.
Average knee pain intensity, as well as pain on walking, were
quanti ﬁed over the past week using 11-item NRSs ( ‘no pain ’(score0) and ‘worst pain possible ’(score 10)). These scales have excellent
testeretest reliability and construct validity in people with arthritic
or other chronic pain conditions24,25.
The Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain (ICOAP)
questionnaire is an 11-item tool designed to assess pain in hip or

knee OA taking into account both constant and intermittent pain
experiences. All items are constructed as ﬁve-point Likert response
scales. For questions asking about intensity, terminal response
options are ‘not at all ’(score 0) and ‘extremely ’(score 4), while
those about frequency have terminal response options of ‘never ’
(score 0) to ‘very often ’(score 4). To calculate constant and inter-
mittent pain subscale scores, scores for items one through ﬁve are
summed giving a maximum score of 20 whereas scores for items 6
through 11 are summed giving a maximum score of 24, respec-
tively. Intermittent and constant pain scores were transformed and
summed to obtain total scores ranging 0 (no pain) to 100
(maximum pain), which were used for analysis. ICOAP showed
excellent reliability, internal consistency and construct validity in
OA25,26.
Although not validated as an indicator of neuropathy in OA, the
painDETECT questionnaire classi ﬁes pain as unlikely, unclear/
possible or likely to have a neuropathic-like component ( www.
pﬁzerpatientreportedoutcomes.com ). The tool includes three
questions about knee pain intensity rated via NRSs ( ‘no pain ’(score
0) to ‘worst pain possible ’(score 10)), pain course pattern rated via
a diagram displaying four possible pain course patterns (scored /C01
to 2 depending on which pain course pattern is selected), a question
about pain radiation (answered yes/no, and scored 2 or 0 respec-
tively), and seven questions about somatosensory phenomena each
rated on 6-point Likert scales ( ‘never ’(score 0) to ‘very strongly ’
(score 5)). Total scores are obtained by summing scores for all items,
ranging from 0 to 38. Higher scores indicate more neuropathic-like
symptoms. Scores of /C2012 indicate pain is unlikely to be neuropathic
and scores of /C2119 suggest pain is likely to have a neuropathic
component. Scores /C2113 and /C2018 indicate uncertain results and the
possibility of a neuropathic component27. We categorised partici-
pants accordingly and also used mean scores for analyses. pain-
DETECT has excellent test eretest reliability and good internal
consistency in symptomatic knee OA4,28.
Presence of current symptoms (pain, aching, discomfort or
stiffness) at other joints (each of hand, neck, back, hip, foot/ankle,
shoulder) was evaluated by a simple yes/no categorization at each
site. We also calculated the total number of distant sites with cur-
rent symptoms for each participant.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 22, IBM
Statistics, Armonk, New York, USA). Level of signi ﬁcance was set at
a<0.05. Descriptive statistics were calculated and continuous
variables reported as means (standard deviations, SD). Categorical
data are presented as n(%) and 95% con ﬁdence intervals (95% CI)29.
Standard diagnostic residual plots were used to check normality
assumptions.
To address our ﬁrst aim in describing the locations of pain, we
undertook the following descriptive analyses, given that pain lo-
cations can be described in any number of ways:
i) Pain zones eProportions of participants reporting pain in
each of the 10 zones [ Fig. 2(A) ] on the PKPM.
ii) Pain regions ePain zone data was collapsed into pain regions
[Fig. 2(B) ]9:‘Anterior ’(pain reported in (any of) lateral and
medial patella, quadriceps tendon or patella tendon zones),
‘Medial ’(pain in (any of) superior medial and medial joint
line area zones), ‘Lateral ’(pain in (any of) superior lateral and
lateral joint line area zones), ‘Posterior ’(pain in posterior
knee zone) or ‘Tibia ’(pain in tibial zone).
iii) Pain patterns eGiven that participants could theoretically
experience pain in any combination of pain regions, we
classi ﬁed an individual's pattern according to the location ofeach individual's pain regions9. For example an individual
with pain in both anterior and medial regions was classi ﬁed
as an ‘anterior-medial ’pattern, whilst a person with only
medial region pain was classed as an ‘isolated medial ’
pattern. In cases where more than two regions were affected
by pain (e.g., a person with anterior, lateral and posterior
pain regions), the participant was classi ﬁed as having a
‘diffuse pain ’pattern2,9.
Thus, “pain zones ”were collapsed into “pain regions ”to facili-
tate categorization of participants under single, and mutually
exclusive, “pain patterns ”9, presented as proportions relative to the
total sample. Thus, proportions also provide a measure of sensi-
tivity of the pain zones/patterns for detecting radiographic medial
TFJOA, according to the following formula and example:
Sensitivity ¼½True Positives =ðTrue Positives þFalse Negatives Þ/C138
Example ¼½People with radiographic medial TFJOA and pain
in the medial joint line zone =ðPeople with
radiographic medial TFJOA and pain in the medial
joint line zone þPeople with radiographic medial
TFJOA and no pain in the medial joint line zone Þ/C138
To address our second aim, we compared the differences in
clinical symptoms across most common pain patterns. A one-way
Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to investigate
differences in continuous clinical variables across groups, with age,
gender, BMI and history of knee surgery included as covariates
given these variables have previously been associated with pain
patterns in knee OA3,9. Subsequently, Least Signi ﬁcant Difference
(LSD) post-hoc tests were used to further investigate signi ﬁcant
main between-group effects. Given relatively low frequency counts
of participants with likely neuropathic-like pain based on pain-
DETECT scores, we categorised all participants with scores /C2113 as
having possible/likely neuropathic-like symptoms. We compared
proportions of those with unlikely neuropathic-like symptoms to
those with possible/likely neuropathic-like symptoms across the
most common patterns using a Chi-squared test. Chi-squared tests
also compared prevalence of symptoms at other sites across com-
mon pain patterns.
Results
Participant characteristics are presented in Table I . Approxi-
mately half the sample was female, and on average the cohort was
overweight. A spread of radiographic tibiofemoral disease severity
was evident across participants based on KL grading, with grades 2,
3 and 4 similarly represented.
The proportion of the cohort reporting pain in each of the 10
knee zones on the PKPM is described in Table II , and summarized
according to region in Fig. 2(B) . Pain was most frequently reported
at the medial joint line (75% of participants), followed by the
patellar tendon (38%) and posterior zones (37%). The least
frequently affected zone was the quadriceps tendon (5%). Most
people reported pain in more than one zone, with predominantly
two or three zones of pain identi ﬁed by 35% (95% CI 28 e43%) and
32% (95% CI 24 e39%) of participants respectively. A single zone of
pain was reported by 23% (95% CI 16 e30%) of people, and 8% (95% CI
4e13%) and 2% (95% CI 0 e4%) reported pain in 4 and 5 zones,
respectively. Thus, the most sensitive pain zone for detecting
radiographic medial TFJOA was the medial joint line, with a sensi-
tivity of 75%.A. Van Ginckel et al. / Osteoarthritis and Cartilage 24 (2016) 1135 e1142 1138

Pain patterns are described in Table III , with a wide variety of
patterns observed. Most common patterns were diffuse pain (41%
of the cohort), followed by isolated medial pain (16%), anterior-
medial pain (12%) and medial-posterior pain (11%). Sensitivity of
the isolated medial pain pattern for detecting people with radio-graphic medial TFJOA was thus quite low at only 16%.
Clinical symptoms for the sample are described in Table I .
Table IV summarizes clinical symptoms across the most common
pain patterns ( n¼133). Participants with diffuse pain reported
signiﬁcantly worse WOMAC pain (mean difference 1.5 units (95% CI
0.1e2.9), P¼0.032) and function scores (mean difference 5.3 units
(95% CI 0.3 e10.3), P¼0.037) compared to those with anterior-
medial pain. Similarly, ICOAP total score (mean difference 9.7
units (95% CI 2.2 e17.3), P¼0.012) was signi ﬁcantly higher with a
diffuse pattern compared to anterior-medial patterns. Mean pain-
DETECT scores were higher in both the diffuse pain (mean differ-
ence 3.7 units (95% CI 1.1 e6.4), P¼0.007) and posterior-medial
patterns (mean difference 4.2 units (95% CI 0.8 e7.6), P¼0.017)
relative to anterior-medial patterns. This was re ﬂected in a ten-
dency for a higher proportion of people with possible/likely
neuropathic-like pain in the diffuse ( n¼18, 26%) and posterior-
medial group ( n¼4, 22%) when compared to the anterior-medial
group ( n¼1, 5%) ( P¼0.25). Whilst the mean number of distant
sites with symptoms did not signi ﬁcantly differ across pain patterns
(P¼0.65), a signi ﬁcantly greater proportion of participants with
diffuse patterns ( n¼40, 59%) reported concomitant back symp-
toms compared to isolated medial patterns ( n¼7, 26%) ( P¼0.032).Table I

Discussion
The goal of this study was to describe location of knee pain in
deﬁnite medial TFJOA using the patient-administered PKPM, and to
examine differences in clinical symptoms across the most common
pain patterns. Despite all participants having radiographic medial
TFJOA, we found only 16% of people reported isolated medial knee
pain, and 15% did not experience any medial pain (in either the
medial joint line or superior medial knee zones) at all. A wide variety
of patterns were observed, with the most common being diffuse
pain. Some patterns were associated with clinical symptoms. Spe-
ciﬁcally, people with diffuse pain reported worse pain and physical
function compared to anterior-medial patterns, although only dif-
ferences in function approach a clinically relevant threshold. While
a greater proportion of people with diffuse pain suffered back
symptoms, a tendency existed for more participants with both
diffuse and posterior-medial pain to experience possible/likely
neuropathic-like symptoms than those with anterior-medial pat-
terns, although the clinical relevance of these ﬁndings is uncertain.
In the present study, zones most frequently affected by pain
were the medial joint line, followed by the patellar tendon, pos-
terior and superior medial knee. Consequently, the medial, anterior
and posterior knee regions were most often identi ﬁed as painful
locations. Our ﬁnding that the medial and anterior knee were
frequently affected by pain agrees with data derived from other
mapping methods in knee OA2,3,9,10. However, previous research
has suggested that the posterior knee is an infrequent pain loca-
tion2,9. We found 37% of our cohort reporting posterior knee pain,
compared to only 5 e11% reported previously in people with or at
risk of knee OA2. Although the posterior knee was included in di-
agrams utilized in elderly adults with frequent knee pain and with
or without radiographic knee OA in previous studies2,9, this region
either was excluded a priori as a potential site of pain9or may have
been under-reported as a result of patient positioning at the time of
data collection2. Common interviewer-administered methods of
knee pain mapping often require participants to sit on the edge of
an examination table (knees ﬂexed to 90/C14) and point to painful sites
on their knee2, which may limit participants ability to identify
painful posterior knee zones. Plausible contributors to posterior
knee pain in OA include a Baker's cyst secondary to degenerative
joint changes, injuries or calci ﬁcation in the popliteus tendon,gastrocnemius or hamstrings injuries, or referred pain from the
lumbar spine30.
In contrast to our ﬁndings, Thompson et al.2concluded that
knee OA pain was characterized by a localized, rather than
diffuse, pain pattern. These authors observed only 24% of par-
ticipants with diffuse pain as opposed to half with local pain.
This may be because Thompson et al.2analysed pain maps from a
sample predominantly comprising people with milder disease on
average (73% of the cohort with KL grades <2) when compared to
our sample. Differences between studies may also be due to
different mapping methods and de ﬁnitions used. In the studies
by Thompson and colleagues2,3, participants who could not
identify localized pain with one or two ﬁngers, or regional pain
with their hand covering the painful area, and/or those who said
the pain was “all over ”were classi ﬁed as having diffuse pain. Our
observations agree with Wood et al.9who, by using a 13-zone
interviewer-administered knee diagram, described whole knee
pain as the most common pattern in symptomatic radiographic
knee OA, followed by an isolated medial and anterior-medial
knee pain pattern.
Our results con ﬁrm that pain and physical dysfunction are more
severe in diffuse pain compared to more localized patterns3,9,10,31,
however only differences in the WOMAC function scores approach
the minimal clinically relevant difference32. Ours is the ﬁrst study
to relate knee pain patterns to painDETECT scores. Although not
statistically signi ﬁcant, we found 26% of people with diffuse pain
had pain with a possible/likely neuropathic-like component
compared to 5% with anterior-medial patterns and 4% of isolated
medial pain. While the majority of our cohort experienced
nociceptive-like symptoms, our data suggest that neuropathic-like
pain may be more frequent amongst those with diffuse pain.
Interestingly, we also observed that 22% of people with medial-posterior patterns had pain with a possible/likely neuropathic-
like component. We cannot draw conclusions, or make assump-
tions about, causes of pain from our present study. While the
increased neuropathic-like symptoms associated with diffuse pain
patterns may be due to peripheral neuropathy resulting from OA
pathological processes, these ﬁndings may also indicate radicul-
opathy or other such neuropathic issue unrelated to knee OA. Our
data, showing a high proportion of back pain in people with diffuse
knee pain, supports the latter.Table IV

Our study has a number of limitations. We had a relatively small
sample size. Given the wide variety of patterns observed, this
resulted in small frequency counts for some patterns, which limited
our analyses to the most frequently occurring patterns. We also
conﬁned the PKPM assessment to the most painful eligible knee,
despite the high prevalence of bilateral disease in this population.
We thus did not assess pain locations and patterns in the contra-
lateral knee, which could quite feasibly in ﬂuence clinical symptoms
in this population. Although our participants were selected on the
basis of de ﬁnite radiographic medial TFJOA, many participants will
have had concomitant lateral and/or patellofemoral OA, which
probably explains the wide variety of pain locations reported in our
cohort. As such one cannot generalize our ﬁndings to all persons
with knee OA or knee pain. Finally, this was a cross-sectional study.
We were not able to capture the ﬂuctuating nature of pain locations
in knee OA nor could we investigate the potential impact on
changes in clinical symptoms over time.
Our study has implications for both clinical practice and future
research. Clinicians should consider diffuse pain and posterior knee
pain as common in medial TFJOA and should be aware that these
pain patterns are associated with greater symptomatic burden onafﬂicted patients. Therefore, clinical assessment and treatment
should not only focus on anterior-medial knee pain, the traditional
targets for physical therapists treating people with knee pain, but
should also contemplate possible sources of posterior knee pain.
Although no gold standard test exists for diagnosing neuropathic
pain in knee OA, assessment should also consider evaluation of
neuropathic-like symptoms, which may sometimes go unrecog-
nized in the typical clinical assessment of a patient with OA
4. Future
research should also aim to elucidate the underlying causes that
drive pain patterns in people with knee OA.
Our data show that not all people with medial radiographic
TFJOA experience pain in the medial knee regions, supporting
previous studies that show knee pain location is not well corre-
lated with radiographic OA9. This has implications for re-
searchers, who should not necessarily rely on subjective reports
of medially-located knee pain to identify research participants
with medial TFJOA. Although pain in the medial joint line zone
had a sensitivity of 75% for detecting people with radiographic
medial TFJOA, a pattern of isolated medial knee pain yielded a
sensitivity of only 16%. Hence, our data suggest that researchers
would be best to select patients on pain at the medial joint line
zone, irrespective of the presence of concurrent pain in other
zones, rather than on the basis of pain isolated to the medial
knee region. We did not include a cohort without radiographic
TFJOA, therefore we could not determine the speci ﬁcity of knee
pain locations for diagnostic purposes and future research in this
area is thus warranted.
Conclusion
In medial TFJOA, a range of pain patterns can be expected.
However, diffuse knee pain is most common and associated with
more severe knee pain and physical dysfunction than anterior-
medial patterns. Although neuropathic-like symptoms were rela-
tively uncommon in our cohort, people with diffuse or posterior-medial pain tended to experience more neuropathic-like symp-
toms. Future research should aim to further understand the un-
derlying causes of pain locations in knee OA.
