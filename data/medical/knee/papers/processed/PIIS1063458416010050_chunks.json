Participants completed the PKPM indicating allrelevant pain zones of their most painful knee. Pain zones were collapsed into regions to determine\npatterns of pain. Symptoms were quanti ﬁed using numeric rating scales (NRSs) of pain severity, Western\nOntario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Intermittent and Constant Osteoar-thritis Pain (ICOAP) and painDETECT questionnaires. Symptoms at other joints were categorised as\npresent/absent.\nResults: The medial joint line ( n¼123, 75%), patellar tendon ( n¼62, 38%) and posterior knee ( n¼61,\n37%) were the most frequently reported pain zones. The most frequent patterns were diffuse (41%),\nisolated medial (16%), anterior-medial (12%) and medial-posterior (11%) pain. WOMAC and ICOAP scores\nwere higher in the diffuse compared to anterior-medial patterns. Mean PainDETECT scores were higherwith both diffuse and medial-posterior pain relative to anterior-medial pain.Conclusion: Only 16% of the cohort indicated isolated medial knee pain, whilst a diffuse pain pattern was\nmost common. People with diffuse knee pain reported more severe pain and physical dysfunction than\nthose with anterior-medial pain. Prevalence of possible/likely neuropathic-like symptoms tended to bemore frequent in diffuse and posterior-medial patterns compared to anterior-medial pain.\n©2016 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

Its aetiology is complex and clinical presentation\nheterogeneous2e4. For clinicians, pain location is a standard\ncomponent of assessment to assist diagnosis of a clinical problem\nand to guide decision-making regarding the most appropriate\ntreatment course. For researchers, pain location may be used as aselection criterion for a given study (e.g., medial knee pain to in-\ncrease likelihood of recruiting those with medial tibiofemoral OA\n(TFJOA))5e8. Despite the plethora of research evaluating pain ex-\nperiences associated with knee OA, there are relatively few studies\nevaluating location of pain2,9e11.\nTypically, location of knee pain has been ascertained using\ninterviewer-administered proxy knee representations where the\ninterviewer maps painful sites onto a diagram after the patient had\ndescribed and/or pointed to the location(s) of pain2,3,9,11 e14.\nAdministrative burden aside, interviewer-mapped assessments\nmay have limited accuracy because of interviewer errors and/or\nrecall or coding bias15. Additionally, numerous diagrammatic knee\nrepresentations have been used, which have not been validated\nand/or evaluated for reliability2,9e11,14.

Pain location appears to impact severity\nof pain and physical dysfunction in knee OA, as poorer clinical\noutcomes have been reported with more generalized pain pat-\nterns3,9,10. However the current literature is limited by the use of\ninterviewer-dependent methods, and/or knee diagrams that fail to\nrepresent the entire knee. Furthermore, previous research on pain\nlocation in knee OA is largely limited to heterogeneous samples\n(including chronic knee pain patients with or without radiographic\nOA) rendering resulting patterns dif ﬁcult to interpret and apply to\nclinical practice and/or research. Given that medial TFJOA is a\ncommon pattern of OA16, research evaluating pain location in\npeople with de ﬁnite evidence of medial TFJOA is warranted.\nFurther, no study in knee OA has evaluated relationships between\npain location and neuropathic-like symptoms.\nThe Photographic Knee Pain Map (PKPM) was developed to\novercome limitations of previous methods15. The PKPM provides a\nphotographic representation of both knees. The patients them-\nselves indicate pain locations in their knees by marking the relevant\nareas on the photographs with small crosses. Subsequently, re-searchers use a transparency template to overlay on the photo-\ngraphs mapping painful areas to distinct knee zones. This template\nidenti ﬁes 10 zones with margins based on anatomic boundaries\n15.\nThis patient-administered instrument has generally good to very\ngood intra-rater and inter-rater reliability, and has demonstrated\nconvergent validity against an interviewer-administered knee pain\nmap2in patients with knee pathology15. Although the PKPM has\nbeen applied in a cross-sectional sample undergoing arthroscopy\nfor a range of knee pathologies17, it has not been used to identify\npain location in knee OA.\nThe aims of this study were two-fold. Firstly, we aimed to\ndescribe locations and patterns of knee pain in people with radio-\ngraphic medial TFJOA using the patient-administered PKPM. Sec-\nondly, we aimed to compare the differences in knee pain (severity,\nnature (intermittent or constant) and quality (possible/likely\nneuropathic-like symptoms)), physical dysfunction and presence of\nsymptoms at other sites across the most common patterns of pain\nlocation to determine whether pain location is associated with\nclinical symptoms.\nMaterials and methods\nThis cross-sectional analysis utilized baseline data of an ongoing\nrandomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the effects of\nunloading shoes in medial TFJOA18. Data for this cross-sectional\nstudy were collected at baseline in the RCT, prior to randomization.\nParticipants\nData from 164 participants with medial TFJOA enrolled in the\nRCT were used. Participants were recruited from the community via\nadvertisements in social and print media, radio and television and\nour volunteer database. Medial TFJOA was classi ﬁed according to\nAmerican College of Rheumatology criteria19. Inclusion criteria\nwere: (1) aged /C2150 years; (2) knee pain on most days of the past\nmonth; (3) average pain score of /C214 on an 11-point numerical\nrating scale (Numeric rating scale (NRS), terminal descriptors ‘no\npain ’and ‘worst pain possible ’) in the past week; (4) de ﬁnite X-ray\nevidence of OA (Kellgren eLawrence (KL) /C21grade 2)20; and (5)\ndeﬁnite X-ray evidence of medial TFJOA (at least grade 1 medial\nosteophytes and medial /C21lateral osteophytes, and at least grade 1\nmedial joint space narrowing (JSN) and medial >lateral JSN) using a\nradiographic atlas21). Major exclusion criteria included: (1) intra-\narticular corticosteroid injections or knee surgery to either knee(past 3 months); (2) history of knee joint replacement or high tibial\nosteotomy; (3) systemic arthritic conditions; (4) any other\nmuscular, joint or neurological condition affecting lower limb\nfunction; (5) a body mass index (BMI) /C2136 kg/m2(due to dif ﬁ-\nculties in three-dimensional gait analysis in the RCT) and/or; (6)\nankle/foot pathology or pain that was either perceived as worse\nthan knee pain and/or required treatment in the past 6 months18.\nFor bilaterally eligible knees, only the most symptomatic knee\nwas evaluated. If both knees were rated as equally painful, the right\nknee was evaluated. Ethics approval was obtained from The Uni-\nversity's Human Research Ethics Committee. All participants pro-\nvided written informed consent.\nRadiographic evaluation\nRadiographic severity of TFJOA was assessed from semi ﬂexed\nposteroanterior weightbearing X-rays. The KL grade20was used to\nrate overall severity of TFJOA, where grade 2 ¼deﬁnite osteophytes\nand possible JSN, grade 3 ¼moderate multiple osteophytes, de ﬁ-\nnite JSN and possible bone deformity and grade 4 ¼large osteo-\nphytes, marked JSN, severe sclerosis and de ﬁnite bone deformity20.\nA radiographic atlas21was used to rate medial and lateral tibiofe-\nmoral JSN and each of medial and lateral tibial and femoral osteo-\nphytes (Grade 0 ¼normal, Grade 1 ¼mild, Grade 2 ¼moderate,\nGrade 3 ¼severe). Radiographs were evaluated by the same\nmusculoskeletal researcher with >10 years of experience in grading\nradiographic knee OA (RSH). In our laboratory, we have previously\nreported intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of KL grades\n(weighted kappa) of 0.83 e0.87 and 0.87, respectively22.\nDescriptive characteristics\nDemographics were collected by questionnaire and included\nage, gender, duration of symptoms and previous knee surgery.\nHeight and weight were measured to calculate BMI.\nKnee pain location\nThe PKPM was used to determine location of knee pain15. Par-\nticipants marked all pain locations in their most symptomatic\neligible knee using small crosses upon a paper copy of a photo-\ngraphic representation of the anterior view of a pair of knees\n(Fig. 1 ). Additionally, a tick box below the photograph enabled\nparticipants to report pain in the posterior knee (as present or\nabsent). Subsequently, a template transparency dividing the knee\ninto nine anterior zones based upon anatomic landmarks (lateral\nand medial joint line areas, superior lateral and medial zone,\nquadriceps tendon, lateral and medial patella, patella tendon and\ntibia) was overlaid on the photograph [ Fig. 2(A) ]. For each zone,\npain was recorded as present if one or more marks were located in\nthe zone as per the bordering lines on the transparency. Marks\nlocated on bordering lines indicated pain in both adjacent zones.\nThus, for each participant, pain was recorded as either present or\nabsent in each of the 10 zones (nine anterior and one posterior\nzone)15,17.\nClinical symptoms\nThe Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis\nIndex (WOMAC) was administered to assess pain and physical\nfunction during daily tasks using the respective subscales. The pain\nsubscale has ﬁve items with a ﬁve-point Likert response scale ( ‘no\npain ’(score 0) to ‘severe pain ’(score 4)) and giving a maximum\nscore of 20.

All items are constructed as ﬁve-point Likert response\nscales. For questions asking about intensity, terminal response\noptions are ‘not at all ’(score 0) and ‘extremely ’(score 4), while\nthose about frequency have terminal response options of ‘never ’\n(score 0) to ‘very often ’(score 4). To calculate constant and inter-\nmittent pain subscale scores, scores for items one through ﬁve are\nsummed giving a maximum score of 20 whereas scores for items 6\nthrough 11 are summed giving a maximum score of 24, respec-\ntively. Intermittent and constant pain scores were transformed and\nsummed to obtain total scores ranging 0 (no pain) to 100\n(maximum pain), which were used for analysis. ICOAP showed\nexcellent reliability, internal consistency and construct validity in\nOA25,26.\nAlthough not validated as an indicator of neuropathy in OA, the\npainDETECT questionnaire classi ﬁes pain as unlikely, unclear/\npossible or likely to have a neuropathic-like component ( www.\npﬁzerpatientreportedoutcomes.com ). The tool includes three\nquestions about knee pain intensity rated via NRSs ( ‘no pain ’(score\n0) to ‘worst pain possible ’(score 10)), pain course pattern rated via\na diagram displaying four possible pain course patterns (scored /C01\nto 2 depending on which pain course pattern is selected), a question\nabout pain radiation (answered yes/no, and scored 2 or 0 respec-\ntively), and seven questions about somatosensory phenomena each\nrated on 6-point Likert scales ( ‘never ’(score 0) to ‘very strongly ’\n(score 5)). Total scores are obtained by summing scores for all items,\nranging from 0 to 38. Higher scores indicate more neuropathic-like\nsymptoms. Scores of /C2012 indicate pain is unlikely to be neuropathic\nand scores of /C2119 suggest pain is likely to have a neuropathic\ncomponent. Scores /C2113 and /C2018 indicate uncertain results and the\npossibility of a neuropathic component27. We categorised partici-\npants accordingly and also used mean scores for analyses. pain-\nDETECT has excellent test eretest reliability and good internal\nconsistency in symptomatic knee OA4,28.\nPresence of current symptoms (pain, aching, discomfort or\nstiffness) at other joints (each of hand, neck, back, hip, foot/ankle,\nshoulder) was evaluated by a simple yes/no categorization at each\nsite. We also calculated the total number of distant sites with cur-\nrent symptoms for each participant.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 22, IBM\nStatistics, Armonk, New York, USA). Level of signi ﬁcance was set at\na<0.05. Descriptive statistics were calculated and continuous\nvariables reported as means (standard deviations, SD). Categorical\ndata are presented as n(%) and 95% con ﬁdence intervals (95% CI)29.\nStandard diagnostic residual plots were used to check normality\nassumptions.\nTo address our ﬁrst aim in describing the locations of pain, we\nundertook the following descriptive analyses, given that pain lo-\ncations can be described in any number of ways:\ni) Pain zones eProportions of participants reporting pain in\neach of the 10 zones [ Fig. 2(A) ] on the PKPM.\nii) Pain regions ePain zone data was collapsed into pain regions\n[Fig. 2(B) ]9:‘Anterior ’(pain reported in (any of) lateral and\nmedial patella, quadriceps tendon or patella tendon zones),\n‘Medial ’(pain in (any of) superior medial and medial joint\nline area zones), ‘Lateral ’(pain in (any of) superior lateral and\nlateral joint line area zones), ‘Posterior ’(pain in posterior\nknee zone) or ‘Tibia ’(pain in tibial zone).\niii) Pain patterns eGiven that participants could theoretically\nexperience pain in any combination of pain regions, we\nclassi ﬁed an individual's pattern according to the location ofeach individual's pain regions9. For example an individual\nwith pain in both anterior and medial regions was classi ﬁed\nas an ‘anterior-medial ’pattern, whilst a person with only\nmedial region pain was classed as an ‘isolated medial ’\npattern. In cases where more than two regions were affected\nby pain (e.g., a person with anterior, lateral and posterior\npain regions), the participant was classi ﬁed as having a\n‘diffuse pain ’pattern2,9.\nThus, “pain zones ”were collapsed into “pain regions ”to facili-\ntate categorization of participants under single, and mutually\nexclusive, “pain patterns ”9, presented as proportions relative to the\ntotal sample. Thus, proportions also provide a measure of sensi-\ntivity of the pain zones/patterns for detecting radiographic medial\nTFJOA, according to the following formula and example:\nSensitivity ¼½True Positives =ðTrue Positives þFalse Negatives Þ/C138\nExample ¼½People with radiographic medial TFJOA and pain\nin the medial joint line zone =ðPeople with\nradiographic medial TFJOA and pain in the medial\njoint line zone þPeople with radiographic medial\nTFJOA and no pain in the medial joint line zone Þ/C138\nTo address our second aim, we compared the differences in\nclinical symptoms across most common pain patterns. A one-way\nAnalysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to investigate\ndifferences in continuous clinical variables across groups, with age,\ngender, BMI and history of knee surgery included as covariates\ngiven these variables have previously been associated with pain\npatterns in knee OA3,9. Subsequently, Least Signi ﬁcant Difference\n(LSD) post-hoc tests were used to further investigate signi ﬁcant\nmain between-group effects. Given relatively low frequency counts\nof participants with likely neuropathic-like pain based on pain-\nDETECT scores, we categorised all participants with scores /C2113 as\nhaving possible/likely neuropathic-like symptoms. We compared\nproportions of those with unlikely neuropathic-like symptoms to\nthose with possible/likely neuropathic-like symptoms across the\nmost common patterns using a Chi-squared test. Chi-squared tests\nalso compared prevalence of symptoms at other sites across com-\nmon pain patterns.\nResults\nParticipant characteristics are presented in Table I . Approxi-\nmately half the sample was female, and on average the cohort was\noverweight. A spread of radiographic tibiofemoral disease severity\nwas evident across participants based on KL grading, with grades 2,\n3 and 4 similarly represented.\nThe proportion of the cohort reporting pain in each of the 10\nknee zones on the PKPM is described in Table II , and summarized\naccording to region in Fig. 2(B) . Pain was most frequently reported\nat the medial joint line (75% of participants), followed by the\npatellar tendon (38%) and posterior zones (37%). The least\nfrequently affected zone was the quadriceps tendon (5%). Most\npeople reported pain in more than one zone, with predominantly\ntwo or three zones of pain identi ﬁed by 35% (95% CI 28 e43%) and\n32% (95% CI 24 e39%) of participants respectively. A single zone of\npain was reported by 23% (95% CI 16 e30%) of people, and 8% (95% CI\n4e13%) and 2% (95% CI 0 e4%) reported pain in 4 and 5 zones,\nrespectively. Thus, the most sensitive pain zone for detecting\nradiographic medial TFJOA was the medial joint line, with a sensi-\ntivity of 75%.A.

Van Ginckel et al. / Osteoarthritis and Cartilage 24 (2016) 1135 e1142 1139\n\nDiscussion\nThe goal of this study was to describe location of knee pain in\ndeﬁnite medial TFJOA using the patient-administered PKPM, and to\nexamine differences in clinical symptoms across the most common\npain patterns. Despite all participants having radiographic medial\nTFJOA, we found only 16% of people reported isolated medial knee\npain, and 15% did not experience any medial pain (in either the\nmedial joint line or superior medial knee zones) at all. A wide variety\nof patterns were observed, with the most common being diffuse\npain. Some patterns were associated with clinical symptoms. Spe-\nciﬁcally, people with diffuse pain reported worse pain and physical\nfunction compared to anterior-medial patterns, although only dif-\nferences in function approach a clinically relevant threshold. While\na greater proportion of people with diffuse pain suffered back\nsymptoms, a tendency existed for more participants with both\ndiffuse and posterior-medial pain to experience possible/likely\nneuropathic-like symptoms than those with anterior-medial pat-\nterns, although the clinical relevance of these ﬁndings is uncertain.\nIn the present study, zones most frequently affected by pain\nwere the medial joint line, followed by the patellar tendon, pos-\nterior and superior medial knee. Consequently, the medial, anterior\nand posterior knee regions were most often identi ﬁed as painful\nlocations. Our ﬁnding that the medial and anterior knee were\nfrequently affected by pain agrees with data derived from other\nmapping methods in knee OA2,3,9,10. However, previous research\nhas suggested that the posterior knee is an infrequent pain loca-\ntion2,9. We found 37% of our cohort reporting posterior knee pain,\ncompared to only 5 e11% reported previously in people with or at\nrisk of knee OA2. Although the posterior knee was included in di-\nagrams utilized in elderly adults with frequent knee pain and with\nor without radiographic knee OA in previous studies2,9, this region\neither was excluded a priori as a potential site of pain9or may have\nbeen under-reported as a result of patient positioning at the time of\ndata collection2. Common interviewer-administered methods of\nknee pain mapping often require participants to sit on the edge of\nan examination table (knees ﬂexed to 90/C14) and point to painful sites\non their knee2, which may limit participants ability to identify\npainful posterior knee zones. Plausible contributors to posterior\nknee pain in OA include a Baker's cyst secondary to degenerative\njoint changes, injuries or calci ﬁcation in the popliteus tendon,gastrocnemius or hamstrings injuries, or referred pain from the\nlumbar spine30.\nIn contrast to our ﬁndings, Thompson et al.2concluded that\nknee OA pain was characterized by a localized, rather than\ndiffuse, pain pattern. These authors observed only 24% of par-\nticipants with diffuse pain as opposed to half with local pain.\nThis may be because Thompson et al.2analysed pain maps from a\nsample predominantly comprising people with milder disease on\naverage (73% of the cohort with KL grades <2) when compared to\nour sample. Differences between studies may also be due to\ndifferent mapping methods and de ﬁnitions used. In the studies\nby Thompson and colleagues2,3, participants who could not\nidentify localized pain with one or two ﬁngers, or regional pain\nwith their hand covering the painful area, and/or those who said\nthe pain was “all over ”were classi ﬁed as having diffuse pain. Our\nobservations agree with Wood et al.9who, by using a 13-zone\ninterviewer-administered knee diagram, described whole knee\npain as the most common pattern in symptomatic radiographic\nknee OA, followed by an isolated medial and anterior-medial\nknee pain pattern.\nOur results con ﬁrm that pain and physical dysfunction are more\nsevere in diffuse pain compared to more localized patterns3,9,10,31,\nhowever only differences in the WOMAC function scores approach\nthe minimal clinically relevant difference32. Ours is the ﬁrst study\nto relate knee pain patterns to painDETECT scores. Although not\nstatistically signi ﬁcant, we found 26% of people with diffuse pain\nhad pain with a possible/likely neuropathic-like component\ncompared to 5% with anterior-medial patterns and 4% of isolated\nmedial pain. While the majority of our cohort experienced\nnociceptive-like symptoms, our data suggest that neuropathic-like\npain may be more frequent amongst those with diffuse pain.\nInterestingly, we also observed that 22% of people with medial-posterior patterns had pain with a possible/likely neuropathic-\nlike component. We cannot draw conclusions, or make assump-\ntions about, causes of pain from our present study. While the\nincreased neuropathic-like symptoms associated with diffuse pain\npatterns may be due to peripheral neuropathy resulting from OA\npathological processes, these ﬁndings may also indicate radicul-\nopathy or other such neuropathic issue unrelated to knee OA. Our\ndata, showing a high proportion of back pain in people with diffuse\nknee pain, supports the latter.Table IV\nComparison of clinical symptoms across the most common anatomical patterns of pain, reported as mean (SD) unless otherwise stated\nAnatomical pain patterns\nDiffuse ( n¼68) Isolated medial ( n¼27) Anterior-medial ( n¼20) Medial-posterior ( n¼18) P-value *\nNRS pain on walking (score range 0 e10) 6.1 (1.9) 5.5 (1.7) 5.7 (1.6) 6.2 (1.4) 0.15\nNRS average pain (score range 0 e10) 6.0 (1.6) 5.6 (1.5) 5.8 (1.2) 5.6 (1.1) 0.56\nWOMAC pain (score range 0 e20) 9.3 (2.8) z 8.2 (2.6) 7.8 (2.4) 8.5 (3.1) 0.037\nWOMAC physical function (score range 0 e68) 30.9 (9.6) z 27.9 (11.2) 25.6 (7.4) 29.9 (12.5) 0.048\nICOAP total score (score range 0 e100) 41.2 (14.5) z 38.6 (16.5) 31.1 (11.8) 36.6 (19.3) 0.023\npainDETECT total score (score range 0 e38) 9.3 (5.7) z 7.3 (4.9) 5.5 (4.4) 9.5 (5.1) z 0.048\n- Possible/likely neuropathic-like pain (scores 13 e38)y 18 (26%, 16 e37) 4 (15%, 4 e30) 1 (5%, 0 e15) 4 (22%, 6 e39) 0.25\nSymptoms at other joint sites: y\n- Hand 31 (46%, 34 e57) 14 (52%, 33 e70) 6 (30%, 10 e50) 8 (44%, 22 e67) 0.65\n- Neck 34 (50%, 38 e62) 5 (19%, 4 e33) 10 (50%, 25 e70) 7 (39%, 17 e61) 0.07\n- Back 40 (59%, 47 e71)x 7 (26%, 11 e44) 8 (40%, 20 e60) 6 (33%, 11 e56) 0.03\n- Hip 20 (29%, 19 e41) 7 (26%, 11 e41) 3 (15%, 0 e35) 4 (22%, 6 e44) 0.77\n- Shoulder 25 (37%, 25 e49) 11 (41%, 22 e59) 9 (45%, 25 e65) 7 (39%, 17 e61) 0.97\n- Ankle/Foot 30 (44%, 32 e56) 7 (26%, 11 e44) 8 (40%, 20 e60) 7 (39%, 17 e61) 0.37\nNumber of other joint sites with symptoms: 2.6 (1.7) 1.9 (1.7) 2.2 (1.4) 2.2 (1.6) 0.65\n*P-values for one-way ANCOVA main effects controlled for age, gender, BMI and history of previous knee surgery (continuous variables), or P-values for 4 /C22 Chi-square\n(categorical variables), non-signi ﬁcant P-values are rounded off.\ny¼Reported as n(%, 95% CI); ICOAP: higher scores indicate worse pain intensity and related distress for either intermittent or constant pain; WOMAC: higher scores i ndicate\nworse pain or physical function scores in pattern.\nzP<0.05 when compared to the anterior-medial pain pattern.\nxP<0.05 when compared to the isolated medial pain pattern.A.

Van Ginckel et al. / Osteoarthritis and Cartilage 24 (2016) 1135 e1142 1140\n\nOur study has a number of limitations. We had a relatively small\nsample size. Given the wide variety of patterns observed, this\nresulted in small frequency counts for some patterns, which limited\nour analyses to the most frequently occurring patterns. We also\nconﬁned the PKPM assessment to the most painful eligible knee,\ndespite the high prevalence of bilateral disease in this population.\nWe thus did not assess pain locations and patterns in the contra-\nlateral knee, which could quite feasibly in ﬂuence clinical symptoms\nin this population. Although our participants were selected on the\nbasis of de ﬁnite radiographic medial TFJOA, many participants will\nhave had concomitant lateral and/or patellofemoral OA, which\nprobably explains the wide variety of pain locations reported in our\ncohort. As such one cannot generalize our ﬁndings to all persons\nwith knee OA or knee pain. Finally, this was a cross-sectional study.\nWe were not able to capture the ﬂuctuating nature of pain locations\nin knee OA nor could we investigate the potential impact on\nchanges in clinical symptoms over time.\nOur study has implications for both clinical practice and future\nresearch. Clinicians should consider diffuse pain and posterior knee\npain as common in medial TFJOA and should be aware that these\npain patterns are associated with greater symptomatic burden onafﬂicted patients. Therefore, clinical assessment and treatment\nshould not only focus on anterior-medial knee pain, the traditional\ntargets for physical therapists treating people with knee pain, but\nshould also contemplate possible sources of posterior knee pain.\nAlthough no gold standard test exists for diagnosing neuropathic\npain in knee OA, assessment should also consider evaluation of\nneuropathic-like symptoms, which may sometimes go unrecog-\nnized in the typical clinical assessment of a patient with OA\n4. Future\nresearch should also aim to elucidate the underlying causes that\ndrive pain patterns in people with knee OA.\nOur data show that not all people with medial radiographic\nTFJOA experience pain in the medial knee regions, supporting\nprevious studies that show knee pain location is not well corre-\nlated with radiographic OA9. This has implications for re-\nsearchers, who should not necessarily rely on subjective reports\nof medially-located knee pain to identify research participants\nwith medial TFJOA. Although pain in the medial joint line zone\nhad a sensitivity of 75% for detecting people with radiographic\nmedial TFJOA, a pattern of isolated medial knee pain yielded a\nsensitivity of only 16%. Hence, our data suggest that researchers\nwould be best to select patients on pain at the medial joint line\nzone, irrespective of the presence of concurrent pain in other\nzones, rather than on the basis of pain isolated to the medial\nknee region. We did not include a cohort without radiographic\nTFJOA, therefore we could not determine the speci ﬁcity of knee\npain locations for diagnostic purposes and future research in this\narea is thus warranted.\nConclusion\nIn medial TFJOA, a range of pain patterns can be expected.\nHowever, diffuse knee pain is most common and associated with\nmore severe knee pain and physical dysfunction than anterior-\nmedial patterns. Although neuropathic-like symptoms were rela-\ntively uncommon in our cohort, people with diffuse or posterior-medial pain tended to experience more neuropathic-like symp-\ntoms. Future research should aim to further understand the un-\nderlying causes of pain locations in knee OA.\nAuthor contributions\nAVG: analysis and interpretation of the data, drafting the article,\ncritical revision of the article for important intellectual content,\nﬁnal approval of the article; KLB: conception and design, analysisand interpretation of the data, critical revision of the article for\nimportant intellectual content, ﬁnal approval of the article; TW:\nconception and design, analysis and interpretation of the data,\ncritical revision of the article for important intellectual content,\nﬁnal approval of the article; DH: conception and design, analysis\nand interpretation of the data, critical revision of the article for\nimportant intellectual content, ﬁnal approval of the article; PC:\ncritical revision of the article for important intellectual content,\nﬁnal approval of the article, provision of study materials or patients,\ncollection and assembly of data; RH: conception and design, anal-\nysis and interpretation of the data, drafting the article, critical\nrevision of the article for important intellectual content, ﬁnal\napproval of the article, obtaining of funding.\nConﬂicts of interest\nDr. Hinman reports personal fees and other from Asics, Oceania,\npersonal fees for the Osteoarthritis DVD, other from Australian\nResearch Council, Future Fellowship #FT 130100175, personal fees\nfrom Editorial Board member for Physical Therapy journal, outside\nthe submitted work; Dr. Bennell reports personal consultancy feesfrom Physitrack, pending grants with the National Health &Med-\nical Research Council and Australian Research Council, personal\nfees from Asics Oceania, personal fees for the Osteoarthritis DVD,\noutside the submitted work; Mr Wrigley reports pending grants\nfrom the National Health &Medical Research Council and personal\nfees from Asics Oceania; No other con ﬂicts of interest were\nreported.\nRole of the funding source\nThis study was supported by funding from the National Health &\nMedical Research Council (Project Grant #1044396).
