INTRODUCTION
Knee symptoms are the tenth most 
common reason to visit a primary care 
physician in the US.1 It is most important 
to evaluate at an early stage if a patient needs referral to secondary care, whether intra-articular lesions can be ruled out, and 
whether symptoms are likely to be resolved 
with conservative treatment.
1 As meniscal 
tears in the short term lead to disability in 
daily functions, absenteeism from work, 
and inability to perform sports, and in the long term lead to an increased risk of knee 
osteoarthritis (OA), early diagnosis and 
treatment of meniscal tears is important.
2,3
Previous studies indicate that the Joint 
Line Tenderness (JLT) test4 and Thessaly 
test4,5 are accurate for detection of meniscal 
tears in secondary care, but not in primary 
care.6 A new weight-bearing test, the Deep 
Squat test, performed better in primary care.
6 Nevertheless, without additional 
information, it was found that the Deep 
Squat test had limited sensitivity.6 As a 
single test result cannot predict a meniscal tear in primary care,
6 combining the Deep 
Squat test with other predicting variables 
may improve its detection of meniscal 
tears.7
In several studies, predictive variables for 
meniscal tears were identified. Shrier et al 
suggested that effusion can be a useful sign 
in a young person with an acute meniscal 
tear, but not in older individuals with a degenerative non-traumatic tear.
5 In a 
recent systematic review,8 strong evidence was provided that age >60 years, male 
sex, work-related kneeling and squatting, 
and climbing stairs are risk factors for degenerative meniscal tears. Also, strong evidence was found that prolonged waiting 
time for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) 
reconstruction surgery after ACL injury is a risk factor for a medial meniscal 
tear. For acute meniscal tears there is 
strong evidence that playing soccer and 
playing rugby are risk factors. It is unclear, 
however, whether some risk factors (for example, age, sex, work-related kneeling 
and squatting, stair climbing, performing 
sports) also could be usefully combined 
to detect a meniscal tear. Lowery 
et al 
evaluated the effectiveness of a composite examination, determining the presence 
of a meniscal tear.
7 Five variables were 
included: a history of catching or locking of 
the knee, pain with forced hyperextension, 
pain with maximum flexion, pain or audible 
click with McMurray’s test, and joint line 
tenderness. A positive predictive value of 92.3% was found. Patients were already 
scheduled for arthroscopy, however, 
meaning that results are not applicable for primary care screening as the spectrum of 
disease was not comparable.
If early and correct detection of meniscal 
tears could be provided, the primary care physician could make a more informed 
selection for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) referral and subsequent diagnosis.

Abstract
Background 
In primary care, meniscal tears are difficult to 
detect. A quick and easy clinical prediction rule based on patient history and a single meniscal test may help physicians to identify high-risk patients for referral for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Aim
The study objective was to develop and internally validate a clinical prediction rule (CPR) for the detection of meniscal tears in primary care.
Design and setting
In a cross-sectional multicentre study, 121 participants from primary care were included 
if they were aged 18–65 years with knee 
complaints that existed for <6 months, and 
who were suspected to suffer from a meniscal 
tear.
Method
One diagnostic physical meniscal test and 14 clinical variables were considered to be 
predictors of MRI outcome. Using known 
predictors for the presence of meniscal tears, a 
‘quick and easy’ CPR was derived. 
Results
The final CPR included the variables sex, age, weight-bearing during trauma, performing sports, effusion, warmth, discolouration, and Deep Squat test. The final model had an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI = 0.72 to 0.80). A cut-point 
of 150 points yielded an overall sensitivity of 86.1% and a specificity of 45.5%. For this cut-point, the positive predictive value was 55.0%, and the negative predictive value was 81.1%. A scoring system was provided including the corresponding predicted probabilities for a meniscal tear. 
Conclusion
The CPR improved the detection of meniscal tears in primary care. Further evaluation of the CPR in new primary care patients is needed, however, to assess its usefulness.

can be treated conservatively. Therefore, 
as part of a full clinical assessment by 
the primary care physician, the clinical 
prediction rule (CPR) may improve the 
management of knee patients.9,10
Therefore, the purpose of this study 
was to develop and validate a prediction model for the detection of meniscal tears 
in primary care.
METHOD
Study design
Data on the history and physical examination 
of participants with knee complaints visiting 
their GP or physical therapist (PT) including 
the results of MRI were used to develop the CPR. Data were collected from October 
2009 until December 2013 in 14 primary care centres in the Netherlands, where 
24 GPs and 28 PTs referred participants with knee complaints and suspicion of 
a meniscal tear to one of the research centres in Leiderdorp. The four meniscal 
tests were the Thessaly test, JLT test, Deep Squat test, and Squat Lunge test. In earlier 
data analyses, it was found that only one 
test result was predictive in primary care, 
the Deep Squat test.
6 Therefore, only this 
meniscal test was taken into account for 
the current study. Patient characteristics were obtained during interview and physical 
examination (for example, effusion, warm knee, discolouration, and extension of 
the knee) by an investigator who did not perform any meniscal test. The meniscal 
test was performed by a physical therapist without knowledge of patient history or 
MRI results. A radiologist with more than 8 years of experience with musculoskeletal 
MRI interpreted the MRI studies. The radiologist was blinded to patient history 
and the meniscal test result.
Participants
Participants were included in the study if 
they were aged 18–65-years and had knee 
complaints that had existed for <6 months. 
The knee complaints had not yet been diagnosed through radiologic examination 
(for example MRI). Those who had had a 
knee arthroplasty or other intra-articular 
knee operations in the past, or MRI 
contraindications, were excluded.
Predictors for meniscal tears
Potential predictive variables were selected through a systematic literature review, 
and other literature.
7,8,11 The following 
candidate predictors were collected: age, 
sex, BMI, origin of complaints, locked 
knee (yes/no), giving way, weight-bearing 
during trauma, performing sports, work-related kneeling or squatting (> 1 hour per 
day), ability to walk the stairs, effusion, 
warm knee, discolouration of the knee, 
pain during extension, and Deep Squat 
test. If a predictor was not interpretable or contradictive according to current 
knowledge, the predictor was excluded 
from the model.
Statistical analysis
From all potential predictor variables, the set of most predictive variables was selected using the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator), after controlling for 
multicollinearity of variables (
r >0.8).12,13 To 
control the shrinkage procedure, a penalty parameter was used. The optimal penalty value l was determined through bootstrap 
samples (
n = 100) and was chosen for the 
highest area under the curve (AUC) to develop the ‘best model’. The penalty value was increased if necessary to derive a more parsimonious model, the ‘tolerance model’. This tolerance model had 2% less AUC than 
that of the best model. After developing 
the best model and the tolerance model, discrimination and calibration of both models were compared to choose the final 
model.
To discriminate between those with and 
without a meniscal tear on MRI, an ROC-
AUC (receiver operating characteristic-
area under the curve) with consecutive 
cut-offs for the predicted probability was used. The AUC is reasonable above 0.7, 
and strong above 0.8, and was presented 
with 95% confidence intervals [CIs].
14 A 
false-negative rate of maximum 15% was deemed acceptable, as the CPR will be used as a screening tool. Calibration of the model, which measures the ability of 
a model to agree between observed and 
predicted outcomes, was assessed through goodness-of-fit with a calibration plot.
Internal validation 
To correct for over-optimism of the 
prediction model, bootstrap resampling How this fits in
Meniscal tests currently used by GPs and 
physical therapists in primary care are not highly accurate and a single test result in itself cannot accurately detect a meniscal tear. This study presents a clinical prediction rule (CPR) for correct detection of meniscal tears. Using the CPR, primary care physicians can make informed selection of patients for MRI referral.
British Journal of General Practice, August 2015  e524

was used.13 The model was fitted repeatedly 
using LASSO regression in 200 bootstrap 
samples of the same size as the original sample, and was compared with the 
performance of the model in the original 
model. After calculating the amount of optimism by the difference between bootstrap AUC and model AUC in the original sample, the optimism corrected AUC was obtained.
13
All analyses were performed in R Studio 
statistics program (version 3.0.2), and the caret, glmnet and rms packages in R.
RESULTS
One-hundred and twenty-one participants 
were included. The Deep Squat test results could not be interpreted for four participants, and they were excluded from 
the analysis. Therefore, in the development cohort as well as in the internal validation 
cohort, 117 participants were analysed. 
Baseline characteristics are summarised in Table 1. MRI confirmation indicated 51 
participants with meniscal tears and 66 
without meniscal tears. Participants with meniscal tears were significantly older 
(46.43 years versus 40.36 years) and were 
more often male (74.5% male with a 
meniscal tear versus 43.9% male without a 
meniscal tear). There were also noticeable 
differences between participants with and without meniscal tears in pain severity on 
a visual analogue scale (VAS) scale (42.16 
versus 53.42 points), performing sports (84.3 versus 72.7%), weight-bearing during 
trauma (47.1 versus 24.2%), and effusion 
(78.4% versus 16.6%). Of the 51 meniscal tears, 80.4% were posterior horn tears 
(Table 1).
In univariate analysis, the candidate 
predictor variables ‘locking’ and ‘ability to walk the stairs’ were not interpretable 
(Table 2). Ability to walk the stairs was more predictive for the presence of a meniscal tear than if a participant had no ability to 
walk the stairs, which was counterintuitive. 
Also, both variables were not significantly different between the two patient groups. 
Therefore, both variables were excluded 
from the model. 
As no multicollinearity of the remaining 
variables was found, all other candidate predictor variables were included in the full model. After deletion of predictors guided by 
the LASSO procedure, only eight predictor 
variables remained in the final model (‘tolerance model’), after the accuracies of 
the ‘best model’ and more parsimonious 
‘tolerance model’ were compared through their AUCs (Table 3, Figure 1). The AUC was 
0.81 (95% CI = 0.74 to 0.89). After correction 
for over-optimism, the final model had an 
AUC of 0.76 (95% CI = 0.72 to 0.80). The 
calibration of the model was good. The final model includes the variables sex, age, 
weight-bearing during trauma, performing 
sports, effusion, warmth, discolouration, and Deep Squat test.
The resulting prediction rule of these 
variables including a scoring system is shown in Figure 2. Scores from individual participants ranged from 15 to 320 points. 
The distribution of the prediction scores of 
individual participants against the predicted probabilities according to the final model 
is shown in Figure 3. A higher risk score 
on the CPR indicates a higher predicted probability, and a lower risk score indicates 
a lower predicted probability for a meniscal

8.83% to 81.5%. A cut-point of 150 was 
selected, which produced a sensitivity of 
86.1% and a specificity of 45.5%. For this 
cut-point, the positive predictive value (PPV) 
was 55.0%, and the negative predictive value 
(NPV) was 81.1%. Although the c-statistic was 0.76, indicated as a reasonable model

with and without meniscal tears occurred.
DISCUSSION
Summary
The final model contained an AUC of 0.76 
with a 95% CI = 0.72 to 0.80. A score of 
150 points yielded an overall sensitivity of 86.1% and a specificity of 45.5%. For this 
cut-point, the PPV was 55.0%, and the NPV was 81.1%. With a false-negative rate of 
14%, participants with a meniscal tear can 
be managed efficiently.
Strengths and limitations
Some limitations should be noted. First, arthroscopy was not used as a reference 
standard, although it is more accurate than 
MRI. MRI was considered to be a valid and ethical alternative because of its reported 
accuracy.
15 To indicate whether MRI results 
were affected, the results of participants receiving arthroscopy after MRI were 
requested. In the present sample only four of 41 identifiable participants receiving 
arthroscopy after MRI (9.8%) had a positive 
finding for a meniscal tear after a negative finding on MRI. Second, it is not certain that participants were consecutively referred to the study research centre. Participants may 
have been directly referred for MRI by their 
GP without inclusion in the present study. 
Another limitation could be that MRI was 
performed in 18.8% of the cases before the included participants underwent the 
meniscal tests because of organisational 
aspects. Participants were asked to wait with requests for their MRI results before undergoing the meniscal tests. Blinding 
was therefore maintained and also for 
PTs who performed the test and obtained patient characteristics. Considering the 
small contribution of only one physical 
test that was particularly suited to detect posterior horn tears (while the other predictors included in the model are as 
useful for posterior as for anterior horn

tears) the CPR appears to be useful for 
both tears. Last, predictors to derive a more parsimonious CPR were excluded. However, after the reduction of predictor variables the AUC remained largely similar.A strength of the present study is that 
it was the first performed to develop and 
internally validate a CPR for meniscal tears 
in a primary care setting. The CPR is useful 
in primary care, where decisions must be made with minimal time. Another strength is that the predictors were selected through LASSO analysis, a method that improves 
the validation of the model.

Comparison with existing literature
An earlier performed systematic review suggested that age and sex are strong 
factors indicating an association with a 
meniscal tear.
8 As it was believed that 
several of the risk factors investigated also could be predictive factors for meniscal 
tears, in this study next to the variables 
age and sex, the variables BMI, performing sports, stair climbing, work-related kneeling and squatting, and weight-bearing 
during trauma were measured. 
In other primary studies, weight-
bearing during trauma was, similar to 
the present findings, associated with the presence of a meniscal tear.

Discuss this article
Contribute and read comments about this 
article: bjgp.org/lettersfactor for meniscal tears from a previous 
systematic review.8 As a predictive factor, 
however, performing sports stands for an increased active life, without the necessity 
for a moment of trauma during sports. 
The known risk factors BMI, work-related kneeling and squatting, and stair climbing were not included in the final CPR, because 
they did not add much to the accuracy 
with the variables already in the model or 
because the results could not be interpreted because of counterintuitive findings.
The Deep Squat test is the only physical 
examination test included in the final model. Previous research stated that a single test could not predict a meniscal tear accurately.
5,7,17–19 In the final model the 
contribution of this test is low, with only three points added for a positive test result. 
For a physician, however, it is important to 
perform a physical examination test for an overall conclusion and patient expectancy.
In a previous study, effusion was a useful 
sign for a meniscal tear, just as a red or blue colour of the knee, and warmth.
5 
These signs were not specified, however, for younger and older participants, or 
subdivided for acute or degenerative tears. 
Therefore, the contribution of these signs for different patient groups is unclear.
A typical finding was that locking 
was not interpretable, as comparatively fewer participants with meniscal tears experienced locking of the knee than participants without meniscal tears, 
which is in contrast with other reports.
7,11 
Participants may not have interpreted the 
question correctly during history taking, or 
it could be that the finding was a result of 
chance. 
Implications for research and practice
A CPR was developed and internally 
validated for detection of meniscal tears 
in primary care. Variables included in the model are sex, age, weight-bearing during trauma, performing sports, effusion, 
warmth, discolouration, and Deep Squat 
test. Correct detection of meniscal tears leads to informed selection for MRI referral by the primary care physician, which in 
turn may improve management of knee 
patients. The CPR should be a first step in selecting patients for MRI referral in primary care. In future research the CPR 
should be externally validated, to assess 
its accuracy in other primary care settings. 
Also, the CPR needs further development 
and validation to distinguish between acute and degenerative meniscal tears. Finally, the use of the CPR in a management 
pathway should be explored, including time 
to referral for radiologic evaluation and choice of treatment.
