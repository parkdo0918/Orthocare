576 American Family Physician www.aafp.org/afp  Volume 98, Number 9  ◆ November 1, 2018Knee pain affects approximately 25% of adults. The prev -
alence of knee pain has increased almost 65% over the past 
20 years, accounting for nearly 4 million primary care visits 
annually.1,2 The initial evaluation should emphasize exclud -
ing urgent causes while considering the need for referral. A 
standardized, comprehensive history and physical examina -
tion are crucial for differentiating the diagnosis. Nonsurgi -
cal problems do not require immediate definitive diagnosis. 
Imaging and laboratory studies can play a confirmatory or 
diagnostic role when appropriate. This article reviews the 
initial primary care office evaluation of undifferentiated 
knee pain in adults and adolescents (ages 11 to 17 years), 
highlighting key patient history and physical examination findings (Table 11,3-27). The uses of and indications for radi -
ography, musculoskeletal ultrasonography, magnetic reso -
nance imaging (MRI), and laboratory evaluation are also 
addressed.
History
When evaluating knee pain, key aspects of the patient his -
tory include age;  location, onset, duration, and quality of 
pain;  mechanical or systemic symptoms;  history of swell -
ing;  description of any precipitating trauma;  and pertinent 
previous medical or surgical procedures. Patients requiring 
urgent referral generally have severe pain, immediate swell -
ing, and instability or inability to bear weight in association 
with acute trauma, which suggests fracture, dislocation, or 
tendon or ligamentous rupture. Referral is also indicated 
for possible joint infection signs such as fever, swelling, and 
erythema with limited range of motion.

includes inspection, palpation, evaluation of range of motion and strength, neu -
rovascular testing, and special (provocative) tests. Radiographic imaging should 
be reserved for chronic knee pain (more than six weeks) or acute traumatic pain 
in patients who meet specific evidence-based criteria. Musculoskeletal ultraso -
nography allows for detailed evaluation of effusions, cysts (e.g., Baker cyst), and 
superficial structures. Magnetic resonance imaging is rarely used for patients 
with emergent cases and should generally be an option only when surgery is 
considered or when a patient experiences persistent pain despite adequate 
conservative treatment. When the initial history and physical examination suggest but do not confirm a specific diagnosis, 
laboratory tests can be used as a confirmatory or diagnostic tool. ( Am Fam Physician . 2018;  98(9):  576-585. Copyright © 2018

presentation of iliotibial 
band syndrome.3
Posterior . Isolated poste -
rior knee pain is less com -
mon but may occur from 
a symptomatic popliteal 
(Baker) cyst.3,28 Posterior 
knee pain after acute trauma 
raises suspicion for injury of 
the posterior cruciate liga -
ment and posterior portions 
of the meniscus, quadriceps 
tendons, or neurovascular 
structures.28 Chronic poste -
rior knee pain can suggest 
hamstring tendinopathy.28
Diffuse . Chronic, diffuse 
knee pain in adults older 
than 50 years is commonly 
attributable to degenerative 
knee osteoarthritis, particu -
larly when the pain is worse 
at the end of the day, is exac -
erbated by weight-bearing 
activity, and is relieved by 
rest.20 Acute onset of dif -
fuse atraumatic knee pain 
(within hours or days) may 
indicate an infectious eti -
ology, gout, or rheumatoid 
arthritis;  the latter is espe -
cially suspected when the 
pain is bilateral or when it 
occurs simultaneously in 
other joints. In adolescents, 
atraumatic or unexplained 
diffuse knee pain that wors -
ens with activity warrants 
imaging to assess for osteo -
chondrosis8;  similar pain 
that persists at rest or that 
worsens at night should raise 
suspicion for malignancy.26

instability but can also occur in medial plica syndrome18 
(Table 11,3-27). A popping sensation at the time of injury 
may occur in meniscal or ligamentous tears. A knee that is 
“locked” in flexion and that cannot be extended should be 
examined for a meniscal tear.4,14,15 
SWELLING
If the patient has an acute injury, a knee joint effusion 
strongly suggests internal derangement.14,26 Swelling that 
occurs immediately (minutes to a few hours) after injury 
suggests a ligament rupture, intra-articular fracture, or 
patellar dislocation;  swelling that appears within hours to 
a few days suggests a meniscal tear.15,19 Atraumatic swelling 
with erythema or palpable warmth implies gout or pseudo -
gout, arthritic flare, or infection. Swelling that is limited to 
the borders of the patella suggests prepatellar bursitis.4,14,15 
MECHANISM OF INJURY
When determining the mechanism of injury, gather infor -
mation about pain onset, positioning of the knee during 
and after the injury, and subsequent weight-bearing status 
(Table 11,3-27). Meniscal tears commonly result from twist -
ing injuries in the weight-bearing knee. Ligamentous rup -
ture may result from excess deceleration force applied to a 
weight-bearing, fixed, lower extremity or a direct blow to 
the lateral or medial knee. A fracture should be considered 
when patients are unable to walk or limp at least four steps 
both immediately after injury and at first presentation.9,29,30
MEDICAL OR SURGICAL HISTORY
Family physicians should ask patients about previous knee 
or other joint pain, injuries, or surgeries. Physicians should 
also inquire about systemic medical conditions (e.g., autoim -
mune or infectious diseases, sexually transmitted infections) 
and review family history of autoimmune and degenera -
tive conditions. Personal history of knee injury or surgery 
and family history of knee osteoarthritis or joint replace -
ment are established risk factors for knee osteoarthritis.20,21 Additional risk factors for knee osteoarthritis include age 
older than 50 years, female gender, and being overweight.20
Physical Examination
A systematic approach to examination of the knee includes 
inspection, palpation, range of motion and strength evalua -
tion, neurovascular assessment, and special (provocative) tests.
INSPECTION
Erythema, swelling, bruising, lacerations, gross deformity, 
discoloration, and any asymmetry of bony or soft tissue 
landmarks, including atrophy and valgus or varus deformi -
ties, should be noted.
PALPATION
Palpation should assess for pain over all bony and soft tissue 
landmarks (Figure 131), warmth, and effusion. Pes anserine

KNEE PAIN IN ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTSbursitis manifests as a tender nodule over the medial proxi -
mal tibia approximately 3 cm distal to the joint line, while a 
plica can be appreciated as a thin band of tissue most com -
monly near or overlying the medial joint line. A joint that 
is as warm or warmer than the tissue above or below that 
joint indicates infection or inflammation. An evaluation 
for effusion with the ballottement test and “milking” of the 
suprapatellar pouch should be conducted with the patient 
supine with the injured knee in extension.3 
RANGE OF MOTION AND STRENGTH TEST
Range of motion (active and then passive) and strength 
testing (graded 0 to 5) should be used to assess flexion and 
extension of the knee. Normal limits of knee range of motion 
include extension from 0 to –10° and 
flexion to 135°.5 The examiner should 
assess for a lateral patellar tracking 
(“J” sign) vs. normal patellofemoral 
tracking during the range of motion 
examination23,24,32,33 (see figure at 
https://  www.aafp.org/afp/2007/0115/
p194.html#afp20070115p194-f2).
NEUROVASCULAR ASSESSMENT
Neurovascular examination of the knee 
includes assessment of sensation to light 
touch;  deep tendon reflexes (graded 0 to 
4+) of the patellar and Achilles tendons;   
and bilateral palpation of the popli -
teal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial 
pulses (graded 0 to 4+).10
SPECIAL (PROVOCATIVE) TESTS
Special (provocative) tests are used to 
bilaterally assess specific structures 
of the knee;  these tests vary in their 
accuracy (Table 25,11). Pain and effu -
sion may limit the usefulness of these 
tests in the acute setting, requiring 
repeat testing or deferment until effu -
sion has subsided.11
Patellar Apprehension Test. This test 
involves laterally shifting the patella 
and is a variant of the patellar mobil -
ity test;  both of these tests evaluate 
for patellar subluxation6 (see figure at 
https:// www.aafp.org/afp/2007/0115/
p194.html#afp20070115p194-f3 ). 
Patellar tilt and patellar grind (or inhi -
bition) testing (see figure at https:// 
www.aafp.org/afp/2007/0115/p194.html#afp20070115p194-f5) can indicate patellofemoral pain 
syndrome, as can assessment of core stability while the 
patient completes a single leg squat.
Lachman, Anterior Drawer, and Pivot Shift Tests. These 
tests evaluate for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury 
(Table 25,11 and Table 34,6,11,34). The Lachman test is the 
most commonly used technique for assessing the ACL6,7 
(Figure 26).
Gravity “Sag” Sign Near Extension, Active Reduction 
“Quad Activation” of Posterior Tibial Subluxation, and Pos -
terior Drawer Tests. These tests evaluate for posterior collat -
eral ligament (PCL) injury6,34 (Table 34,6,11,34). In one study, the 
sag sign correctly diagnosed PCL injury in 20 of 24 patients, 
and “quad activation” correctly identified PCL injury in 18

tion for meniscal injury;  
however, the effectiveness 
of both tests is often limited 
because of the patient’s pain 
and inability to fully bear

RADIOGRAPHY
Although a comprehensive

the initial evaluation, radi -
ography may be necessary 
to further evaluate undif -
ferentiated knee pain. How -
ever, with a 2% prevalence TABLE 3
Physical Examination Maneuvers for the Knee
Test Description
Anterior cruciate ligament tear
Anterior drawer 
test* With the patient supine on the examining table, flex the hip to 45° and the 
knee to 90°. Sit on the dorsum of the foot, wrap hands around the ham -
strings (ensuring that these muscles are relaxed), then pull and push the 
proximal part of the leg, testing the movement of the tibia on the femur. Do 
these maneuvers in three positions of tibial rotation:  neutral, 30° externally 
rotated, and 30° internally rotated. A normal test result is no more than 6 to  
8 mm of laxity.
Lachman test* With the patient supine on the examining table and the leg slightly externally 
rotated and flexed (20 to 30°) at the examiner’s side, stabilize the femur with 
one hand and apply pressure to the back of the knee with the other hand, 
with the thumb on the joint line. A positive test result is movement of the 
knee with a soft or mushy end point. 
Pivot shift test* Fully extend the knee and rotate the foot internally. Apply a valgus (abduction) 
force while progressively flexing the knee, watching and feeling for translation 
of the tibia on the femur.
Posterior cruciate ligament tear
Posterior drawer 
test The patient should be supine on the examining table with knees flexed to 
90°. While standing at the side of the examination table, the physician looks 
for posterior displacement of the tibia (posterior “sag” sign).4,6,34 The physi -
cian then fixes the patient’s foot in neutral rotation (by sitting on the foot), 
positions thumbs at the tibial tubercle, and places fingers at the posterior 
calf. The physician then pushes posteriorly and assesses for posterior dis -
placement of the tibia.
Gravity “sag” 
sign near exten -
sion testIn a resting position with the distal femur on a 15-cm support and the heel 
resting on the examination table (20° of flexion), the unsupported proximal 
tibia displays a concave anterior contour.
Active reduction 
“quad activation” 
of posterior tibial 
subluxationWhen the patient raises the heel 2 to 3 cm, a normal anterior contour is 
restored.
Meniscal tear
Joint-line 
tenderness Palpate medially or laterally along the knee to the joint line between the 
femur and tibial condyles. Pain on palpation is a positive finding.
McMurray test † Flex the hip and knee maximally. Apply a valgus (abduction) force to the knee 
while externally rotating the foot and passively extending the knee. An audible 
or palpable snap or click with pain during extension suggests a tear of the 
medial meniscus. For the lateral meniscus, apply a varus (adduction) stress 
during internal rotation of the foot and passive extension of the knee.
Thessaly test ‡ Hold patient’s outstretched hands while the patient stands flat footed on the 
floor, internally and externally rotating the affected leg three times with the 
knee flexed 20°. The unaffected leg should be flexed to avoid contact with the 
floor. Patient-reported pain at the medial or lateral joint line is a positive finding.
Effusion
Ballottement 
test § Push the patella posteriorly with two or three fingers using a quick, sharp 
motion. In the presence of a large effusion, the patella descends to the troch -
lea, strikes it with a distinct impact, and flows back to its former position.

KNEE PAIN IN ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTSof fractures in outpatient primary care settings and a low 
diagnostic yield for clinically significant fractures, radi -
ography should be reserved for chronic knee pain of more 
than six weeks duration or acute traumatic pain in patients 
who meet specific evidence-based criteria.11,36
The American College of Radiology Appropriateness  
criteria, the Ottawa Knee Rule (https://  www.mdcalc.com /
ottawa-knee-rule), and the Pittsburgh Knee Rule (https://  
www.mdcalc.com /pittsburgh-knee-rules) provide support 
for imaging decisions. The Ottawa Knee Rule is a vali -
dated tool (98.5% to 100% sensitivity, 49% specificity) that 
decreases unnecessary radiography by 28% to 35% in the 
patient with an acutely injured knee.11,29,31,37-40 A prospective 
validation trial comparing the Ottawa Knee Rule and the 
Pittsburgh Knee Rule showed that each rule is useful, but 
the Pittsburgh rule appears to be more sensitive. Specifi -
cally, the Ottawa rule had a sensitivity of 97% (95% confi -
dence interval [CI], 90% to 99%) and specificity of 27% (95% 
CI, 23% to 30%), whereas the Pittsburgh Knee Rule yielded 
a sensitivity of 99% (95% CI, 94% to 100%) and specificity of 
60% (95% CI, 56% to 64%)30 (Table 411). 
The three recommended radiographic views are antero -
posterior view, lateral view, and Merchant’s view (for the 
patellofemoral joint).30,40 Oblique views can assess for tibial 
plateau fractures, and the notch or tunnel (intracondylar) 
view can visualize osteochondral lesions.4 If osteoarthritis is 
suspected, weight-bearing radiographs should be obtained 
to assess for joint-space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, 
osteophytes, and bony cysts.4,22ULTRASONOGRAPHY
Musculoskeletal ultrasonography performed by a trained 
clinician13,25,41,42 allows for limited evaluation of effusions, 
cysts (e.g., Baker) and superficial tendons, collateral lig -
aments, muscles, vasculature, and nerves. In particular, 
dynamic evaluation of the extensor mechanism (quadriceps 
tendon, patella, and patellar tendon) can be readily assessed. 
Mechanical complaints such as snapping, clicking, or pop -
ping can be evaluated through palpation with an ultrasound 
transducer.40FIGURE 2

KNEE PAIN IN ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTSMRI
Emergent MRI is rarely indicated and 
is typically reserved for potential sur -
gical indications such as dislocation, 
ACL or PCL tear, fracture not visible 
on radiography, vertical meniscal tear, 
malignancy, vascular injury, or osteo -
myelitis. Ideally, MRI will confirm the 
findings from the history and physical 
examination. MRI also may be useful if 
mechanical symptoms (such as locking, 
painful clicking, or inability to fully 
extend the knee) occur or if recurrent 
swelling or persistent pain is present 
after a trial of adequate conservative 
treatment. The American College of 
Radiology has established Appropriate -
ness Criteria for ordering knee MRI.43
Laboratory Examination
When the initial history and physical 
examination suggest but do not con -
firm a specific diagnosis, laboratory 
examination can play a confirma -
tory or diagnostic role. This workup 
could include serology for suspected 
inflammatory conditions (erythrocyte TABLE 4

Internal derangement should be suspected in patients 
with knee trauma and acute effusion.C 3, 4, 6, 7, 11, 12, 
14, 19, 30Rapidity of effusion should be noted.
In patients with suspected meniscal injury, the Thes -
saly test is preferred over the McMurray test or other 
evaluation for joint-line tenderness.C 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 
16, 25, 30, 31, 34Thessaly may be difficult to perform in 
an acute setting because of pain and 
feeling of instability.
The Ottawa Knee Rule should be used to determine 
which patients with acute knee injury require imaging.A 11, 16, 17, 29, 30,
