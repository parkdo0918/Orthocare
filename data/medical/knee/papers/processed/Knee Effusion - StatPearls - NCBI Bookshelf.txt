Continuing Education Activity
The knee joint is a complex structure comprised of bones, ligaments, tendons, cartilage, and synovial fluid, all of
which play integral roles in its function. A knee effusion refers to an abnormal fluid accumulation within the knee
joint. Knee effusions can arise from traumatic injuries, such as ligament tears or fractures, inflammatory conditions
like arthritis, infectious processes such as septic arthritis, or degenerative changes such as osteoarthritis. Factors like
age, activity level, and systemic health conditions may influence the presentation and management of knee effusions.
Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation considering structural changes, potential causes, and patient factors is essential
for optimizing care for individuals with knee effusions.
This activity is designed to develop learners' proficiency in evaluating and managing knee effusions. Participants gain
valuable insights into the condition's possible etiologies, appropriate diagnostic modalities, and evidence-based
interventions, allowing them to collaborate effectively within an interprofessional team caring for patients with knee
effusions.
Objectives:
Identify the signs and symptoms suggestive of a knee effusion.
Determine a clinically guided diagnostic workup for a patient with a possible knee effusion.
Develop a personalized management strategy for a patient diagnosed with a knee effusion.
Enhance communication and collaboration within an interprofessional team caring for patients with knee
effusions to formulate holistic short- and long-term management plans and improve outcomes.

Introduction
The knee is a hinge joint, one of the most frequently injured joints in the body. This joint contains multiple bursae
or saclike structures containing synovial fluid. The bursae are located between the skin and bony prominences. Some
of these bursae communicate with the knee joint. Fluid accumulation in a joint's intraarticular space and bursae is
called an "effusion." 
Knee effusions can occur at any age. The condition often presents with knee swelling, pain, stiffness, and limited
range of motion. Knee effusions arise from various causes. Proper diagnosis and management typically involve
identifying the effusion's underlying cause through clinical evaluation, imaging studies, and possibly joint fluid
analysis. Treatment may include rest, ice, elevation, anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy, and, in some
cases, knee fluid drainage.[1]

The etiology of a knee effusion may vary from acute trauma and infection to chronic systemic conditions, including
degenerative, hematologic, rheumatologic, vasculitic, and oncological conditions.[2]
Minor, asymptomatic effusions can occur in healthy individuals. More significant joint effusions indicate pathology.
Large effusions can give rise to cysts within the popliteal fossa. A knee effusion can consist of synovial fluid or
hemarthrosis and is classified as traumatic or nontraumatic. Knee joint hemarthrosis' primary mechanism is forced
rotation of the loaded joint.[3] 
Hemarthrosis' articular cartilage complications are similar across different age groups, but the etiology varies. In
adults, traumatic hemarthrosis may be due to anterior cruciate ligament ruptures (70%), patellar dislocation (15%),
meniscal tears (10%), osteochondral fragment fractures (5%), and miscellaneous injuries (5%).[4][5][6] Patellar
dislocation was reported to be the most common etiology of traumatic hemarthrosis in adolescent age groups.[7][8] 
Epidemiology
Knee injuries represent over half a million emergency department visits in the United States.[9][10] The knee is
more frequently injured than other joints because it is part of a weight-bearing limb and has less joint congruity than
the hip and ankle.[11] 
The lifetime prevalence of knee swelling has been reported to be as high as 27%.[12] Knee effusions in children most
commonly affect infants and teenagers. Pediatric knee effusion with hemarthrosis usually arises from a sports-related
traumatic knee event.
Pathophysiology
A knee effusion may arise from an acute or chronic, inflammatory or noninflammatory, traumatic or atraumatic
condition. The most common diagnoses in the primary care setting are osteoarthritis, trauma, and gout.[13] A knee
hemarthrosis increases the intracapsular pressure, leading to pain and reduced knee joint range of motion mainly due
to reflex quadriceps muscle firing inhibition.[14] The risk of developing osteoarthritis from longstanding
knee hemarthrosis increases regardless of etiology. Blood and other inflammatory mediators released into the joint
initiate the pathological process of chondral injury. Complex biochemical interactions between various metabolites
and proinflammatory mediators culminate in irreversible articular cartilage damage and joint degeneration as long-
term sequelae.[15][16]
Histopathology
Normally, synovial fluid hyaluronic acid prevents friction and lubricates the knee joint. Synovial fluid has
antibacterial properties that help maintain a sterile environment within the joint. However, synovial microscopic
examination of knee joint effusion reveals abnormal changes. Knee joint effusion consists of synovial fluid and blood
plasma ultrafiltrate and includes hyaluronic acid, glycoproteins, lubricin, proteinases, and collagenases. Inflamed
synovium contains large clefts, allowing molecules of almost any size to pass through its membrane and cause an
effusion. Synovial fluid also contains substances identical to plasma proteins.
History and Physical
History
Evaluating an acutely swollen knee begins with a thorough history and examination of the affected and contralateral
knees. Essential information to elicit include the injury mechanism, onset acuity, symptom duration, previous history
of the ailing joint, aggravating symptoms, and associated systemic manifestations. A knee effusion with a recent
traumatic history may suggest an internal derangement such as a ligament or meniscal tear. In contrast, an atraumatic
effusion is highly suspicious for infection or systemic disease. A history of previous surgery should be determined in
every patient with knee swelling. Patients may complain of swelling and stiffness with decreased range of motion. A
large effusion can cause the inability to completely extend the knee. The patient may keep the knee at 15° of flexion
when at rest.
Red flags25. 11. 13. 오전  2:27 Knee Effusion - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532279/?report=printable 2/10

Red flags include fever, non-weight bearing, loss of distal pulses and sensation distal to the knee, open fractures, and
cellulitis overlying the knee. These red flags typically indicate immediate evaluation. The affected knee should always
be compared with the unaffected knee. In septic arthritis, joint pain, a history of joint swelling, and fever are present
in over 50% of cases.[17] 
Physical Examination
Physical examination should focus on finding signs that can help determine the knee effusion's etiology. Comparing
the contralateral knee is mandatory and always helpful in spotting abnormalities (see Image. Knee Effusion).
Inspection
The absence of dimples is the first sign of effusion and may be easily noted when comparing the affected knee to the
contralateral one. Patellar swelling and suprapatellar bursal distention may be found in more significant effusions.
Deformities and dislocations are noticeable in most scenarios. Skin evaluation for color changes, such as erythema,
may indicate underlying sepsis. The presence of a rash could direct the physician to further investigate for systemic
disorders, particularly rheumatologic, hematologic, and vasculitic conditions. The patient's gait and lower limb
alignment should also be evaluated. Malalignment accompanying chronic conditions may indicate the effusion's
underlying etiology. 
Palpation
The bony and soft tissue landmarks and the joint line should be gently palpated. Joint-line tenderness could indicate
meniscal pathology. Tenderness over a tendon or ligamentous insertion could indicate tendonitis or apophysitis.
Tenderness over the femoral condyles' articular surfaces may indicate osteochondritis dissecans. A subjective joint
pain with no objective tenderness over bony or soft tissue structures most likely points toward arthralgia.
Range of motion assessment
Patients may have a restricted range of motion and pain with ambulation. Excess fluid can cause pressure and
irritation within the joint, contributing to pain and discomfort during weight-bearing activities like walking.
Special tests
The balloon, ballottement, and bulge tests can help confirm knee effusion. The balloon test is performed by
compressing the suprapatellar pouch against the femur with the thumb and fingers, making the effusion more
appreciable. The ballottement test is performed as a continuation of the balloon test by pressing the raised patella
downward against the femur. A gentle patellar tap and float should be appreciated. The bulge test is performed when
only minimal effusion is apparent on inspection. The effusion may be appreciated by milking all the fluid laterally and
pressing it until it forms a medial bulge.
The following special tests may be performed if suspecting specific injuries:
McMurray and Thessaly tests for medial and lateral meniscus tears
Lachman and anterior drawer tests for an anterior cruciate ligament tear
Posterior drawer test for posterior cruciate ligament tear
Varus and valgus stress tests for lateral and medial collateral ligament injuries, respectively
Patellofemoral joint compression test for patellofemoral compartment pathology [18]  
Neurovascular assessment
Knee effusions may cause arterial flow reduction and nerve compression, warranting immediate intervention. The
following structures may be compromised by mass effects arising from a knee effusion:
Popliteal artery, affecting downstream vessels like the anterior and posterior tibial arteries and dorsalis pedis
Peroneal nerve25. 11. 13. 오전  2:27 Knee Effusion - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532279/?report=printable 3/10

Posterior tibial nerve
Lower-limb arterial flow may be assessed by palpation. Posterior tibial nerve function may be examined by ankle
plantar flexion. The superficial peroneal nerve's function may be evaluated by ankle eversion. Great-toe extension
strength testing can help test deep peroneal nerve function. Lower limb sensory tests must also be completed.
Evaluation
Imaging
Weight-bearing radiographs in 3 planes—anteroposterior, lateral, and axial—are indicated in patients presenting with
an acutely swollen knee. Radiography helps evaluate for a fracture, especially if a history of trauma has been
elicited. Plain x-rays can also detect rheumatoid arthritis-related erosive disease. Joint space narrowing may be found
in patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.[19]
A fabella—a sesamoid bone in the gastrocnemius lateral head tendon—may be seen in some individuals' lateral knee
x-rays. This structure can serve as a radioopaque marker for the knee synovium's posterior border. The fabella sign
(fabella displacement) is seen in the presence of a synovial effusion and a popliteal mass. Increased suprapatellar
bursal opacity and widening may also be evident on lateral knee radiographs showing the fabella sign.
An ultrasound can help differentiate between complicated and simple effusions. This modality may also be used
to guide arthrocentesis.
Knee arthroscopy is the gold standard diagnostic modality for evaluating and managing intraarticular knee
pathologies. Clinical examination or magnetic resonance imaging scans are not 100% sensitive in excluding
intraarticular pathologies.
Synovial Fluid Aspirate Analysis
Arthrocentesis and subsequent synovial fluid analysis should be done in all cases of unexplained knee effusion. The
aspirated fluid should be analyzed for cell counts, gram staining, bacterial cultures, and crystal analysis.
The following should be included in the synovial fluid aspirate analysis report:
Complete cell count with differential (white blood cell or WBC, polymorphonuclear or PMN leukocytes)
Crystal examination 
Bacterial culture and gram staining
Viscosity 
Glucose
Hemarthrosis is commonly caused by joint trauma. Polarized microscopy can detect fat droplets, indicating an
articular fracture. Other clotting disorders like hemophilia can cause hemarthrosis in the absence of trauma.
The presence of crystals cannot exclude septic arthritis with certainty. Septic arthritis can occur concurrently with
gout or pseudogout in less than 5% of cases. Meanwhile, a low synovial fluid glucose level suggests joint
infection. Still, low glucose levels are present in only about 50% of patients with septic joints. Rheumatoid arthritis
may also have low synovial fluid glucose. The fasting glucose levels in synovial fluid obtained from joint effusions
are typically less than half of the glucose levels simultaneously measured in the blood. In rheumatoid arthritis, expect
decreased viscosity and poor mucin clot formation.[20]
Septic arthritis
Septic arthritis produces a characteristic combination of synovial fluid aspirate analysis findings. Joint fluid often
appears cloudy or purulent. A cell count with WBCs of more than 50,000 cells/mm is considered diagnostic for
septic arthritis. However, lower counts do not rule out a joint infection.[21] A prosthetic joint with WBCs greater than
1,100 cells/μL is considered septic. Gram stains only identify infective organisms a third of the time. Glucose will be
less than 50% of the serum level.325. 11. 13. 오전  2:27 Knee Effusion - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532279/?report=printable 4/10

Noninflammatory synovial fluid
Noninflammatory synovial fluid usually contains less than 60 to 180 cells per mL, most of which are mononuclear.
Synovial fluid is considered noninflammatory if it contains less than 2000 cells/mL, but most synovial fluid samples
from patients with osteoarthritis contain less than 500 cells per mL.
The most common cause of noninflammatory knee effusions of the knee, with synovial fluid WBC count typically
less than 2000 cells/mL, is osteoarthritis. Other causes include osteonecrosis, Charcot arthropathy, sarcoidosis,
amyloidosis, hypothyroidism, and acromegaly. Inflammatory arthritis, with synovial fluid WBCs greater than 2000
cells/mL, may arise from infection, autoimmune disease, and crystal-induced arthritis. Aspiration of dark brown
serosanguinous fluid should raise the possibility of pigmented villonodular synovitis.
Inflammatory synovial fluid
Various conditions present with synovial fluid WBC count greater than 2,000 leukocytes/mL. These clinical
entities may be distinguished based on leukocytosis severity and differential count. Trauma often manifests with less
than 5000 WBCS/mL. RBCs may also be seen if bleeding occurs in the joint. Toxic synovitis usually has 5,000 to
15,000/mL and less than 25% PMNs. Acute rheumatic fever often has 10,000 to 15,000 and 50% PMNs. Juvenile
rheumatoid arthritis and various other autoimmune conditions usually have 15,000 to 80,000 and 75% PMNs.
Infectious arthritis usually causes the most intense synovial fluid leukocytosis, with cell counts of 50,000 to 200,000
cells/mL containing over 90% PMNs. Lower leukocyte counts in suspected infectious cases are common in early
bacterial arthritis and disseminated gonococcal infection.
Noninfectious conditions like gout, pseudogout, acute rheumatic fever, reactive arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis
can produce a markedly inflammatory synovial effusion. A finding of greater than 90% PMNs despite a relatively low
total leukocyte count should prompt concern for infection or crystal-induced disease. However, the presence
of crystals cannot exclude septic arthritis with certainty.[22] A finding of WBCs greater than 50,000/mm in the
setting of trauma suggests infectious arthritis.
Septic arthritis typically has 80,000 to 200,000 cells/mL and greater than 75% PMNs on synovial fluid aspirate
analysis. Synovial fluid WBC count and percentage of PMN cells from arthrocentesis are the most significant
predictors of septic arthritis. The likelihood ratio increases as the synovial fluid WBC count increases.
Counts greater than 50,000/μL have a likelihood ratio of 7.7 (95% confidence interval, 5.7-11.0). Counts greater than
100,000/μL have a likelihood ratio of 28.0 (95% confidence interval, 12.0-66.0). Finding a PMN cell count of at least
90% on the same synovial fluid sample suggests septic arthritis with a likelihood ratio of 3.4 (95% confidence
interval, 2.8-4.2), while a PMN cell count of less than 90% lowers the likelihood ratio to 0.34 (95% confidence
interval, 0.25-0.47).
Other Labs
Blood tests that can help determine the etiology of knee effusion include the following: 
Lyme titers, especially in the pediatric population with atraumatic unilateral knee effusion [23]
Antistreptolysin-O for poststreptococcal infection [24]
Rapid plasma reagin for syphilis
Elevated WBC in a complete blood count (CBC) for osteomyelitis, inflammation, or malignancy
Inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein and sedimentation rate
Antinuclear antibody for possible autoimmune disorders
Urine studies help determine the presence of urinary tract infections and sexually transmitted diseases, including
gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomonas, which can cause reactive arthritis. Polymerase chain reaction tests of affected
mucosal sites should also be considered if suspecting gonorrhea and chlamydia. Stool cultures can detect salmonella,
yersinia, campylobacter, and shigella, which can all cause reactive arthritis.[25]325. 11. 13. 오전  2:27 Knee Effusion - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532279/?report=printable 5/10

A saline load test may be utilized to determine if a nearby wound communicates with the knee joint. The test
requires injecting 155 mL of normal saline in the knee to reach 95% sensitivity.
Treatment / Management
Pain Control
Acute pain and swelling warrant individualized treatment. Options include splints, cold or ice packs, partial or non-
weight-bearing braces, and analgesics like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Drainage may be
effective if the joint has significant effusion causing pain. If suspecting an infection, the fluid sample should be
obtained, tested, and cultured before starting antibiotics. Intraarticular steroids should be avoided until infection or
other contraindications are first ruled out.
Septic Joint Treatment
Intravenous antibiotics should be initiated for suspected infection after sending joint fluid specimens for analysis. The
most common bacterial agents causing septic arthritis include staphylococci (40%), streptococci (28%), gram-
negative bacilli (19%), mycobacteria (8%), gram-negative cocci (3%), gram-positive bacilli (1%), and anaerobes
(1%). An orthopedic consult may be necessary. Joint drainage is associated with rapid recovery and low morbidity.
Arthroscopy allows internal joint visualization, adhesiolysis, purulent pocket drainage, and necrotic material
debridement.[26]
Managing Ligamentous Injuries
A knee brace may be placed on the affected knee as initial treatment. The patient should be given an outpatient
referral to an orthopedic surgeon for definitive treatment. Complete ligamentous disruption and knee instability
warrant surgical intervention. 
Fractures
An orthopedic specialist determines if conservative or operative management is necessary. The Salter-Harris
classification may be used for pediatric fractures involving the growth plate.
Rheumatologic conditions
NSAIDs or acetaminophen may be used for pain control. A rheumatologist prescribes the definitive treatment.
Reactive Arthritis
The primary infection should be treated with the appropriate antibiotic. NSAIDs and acetaminophen may be used for
pain.
Differential Diagnosis
Knee effusion has broad differential diagnoses that include those listed below. A thorough clinical evaluation and
judicious use of diagnostic studies can differentiate these conditions and guide definitive management.
 Infection
Bacterial
Mycobacterial
Spirochete (Lyme, syphilis)
Viral
Crystal (gout and pseudogout)
Spondyloarthritis
Reactive arthritis
Inflammatory bowel disease25. 11. 13. 오전  2:27 Knee Effusion - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532279/?report=printable 6/10

Hemarthrosis
Acute injury
Osteoarthritis
Osteonecrosis
Malignancy
Autoimmune disorders
Prognosis
The following conditions are associated with poor outcomes in patients with knee effusion:
Age 80 or older
Concomitant involvement of a larger joint, ie, hip or shoulder
Bacterial growth on synovial fluid cultures despite appropriate antibiotic therapy for 7 days 
Delay longer than 7 days before starting treatment
Comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, bacteremia, chronic kidney disease, and rheumatoid arthritis [27]
[28]
Other factors that can impact knee effusion's prognosis include symptom severity, patient adherence, and immune
status.
Complications
Delaying treatment beyond 24 hours may result in permanent joint function limitation and subchondral bone
loss. Bacterial invasion can lead to permanent articular cartilage injury. Prosthetic joint infection may result from an
untreated local bacterial invasion that has spread to the prosthesis hematogenously.[26]
Deterrence and Patient Education
Preventive measures aim to reduce the risk of injury, inflammation, and other factors contributing to the development
of knee effusions. Patients may be educated on maintaining a healthy weight, strengthening the muscles, improving
flexibility, and avoiding overuse to protect from osteoarthritis. Using the proper exercise techniques, wearing
protective pads, and avoiding risky behaviors prevent traumatic knee injuries. Regular medical consultations and
treatment adherence help manage chronic conditions affecting the knees. Staying well-hydrated supports knee joint
lubrication and cushioning. These measures may not prevent all knee effusion cases but can help minimize the risk of
developing the condition.
Pearls and Other Issues
Knee effusion typically presents with swelling, pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion in the affected knee. The
swelling may be visible and feel fluid-filled or boggy upon palpation. The condition may result from various
underlying causes, including trauma, infection, inflammation, and metabolic disorders. Diagnosing knee effusion
involves combining clinical assessment with imaging studies and analysis of the synovial fluid obtained via
arthrocentesis.
Examination of synovial fluid obtained from the affected knee can provide valuable diagnostic information. Analysis
includes evaluating the fluid's appearance, cell count, differential, protein levels, glucose levels, and microbiological
cultures. The management depends on the underlying cause. Treatments range from noninvasive measures such as
cold compress application and NSAID intake to intraarticular injections and more invasive surgical interventions.
Untreated or poorly managed knee effusion can lead to complications such as chronic inflammation, joint stiffness,
cartilage damage, knee instability, and secondary osteoarthritis.25. 11. 13. 오전  2:27 Knee Effusion - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf

7.Poor prognostic indicators include advanced age, presence of concomitant large-joint injuries, treatment delay or
unresponsiveness, and comorbidities. Measures that can prevent knee effusion include maintaining a healthy weight,
avoiding excessive knee stress or overuse, using proper techniques during physical activity, wearing protective gear
when necessary, managing underlying medical conditions, and seeking prompt medical attention for joint injuries or
symptoms of inflammation.
Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes
Managing knee effusions requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including nurses, laboratory
technologists, and clinicians in different specialties. Without proper management, morbidity and mortality from an
undiagnosed knee effusion may increase.
When the triage nurse identifies an acute knee effusion, the primary care or emergency medicine physician must be
notified immediately to determine whether prompt interventions are warranted, as in cases of open fractures and
septic arthritis.
Orthopedic specialists may lend their expertise in managing traumatic cases. Consultation with the pharmacist and
infectious disease clinician about the choice and administration of antibiotics can increase efficacy and patient safety.
Rheumatologists may be involved in cases of autoimmune arthritis. If the patient requires any resources for home, the
social worker and case manager should be notified. Knee pain and decreased mobility warrant the services of a
physical therapist for early ambulation.
All members of the interprofessional team must exercise open communication with the rest of the care team to ensure
optimal patient outcomes, alert appropriate personnel regarding changes in the patient's condition, and maintain
accurate records so that everyone involved in the case has updated, precise patient information from which to make
clinical decisions.
Communication among providers is critical to achieving the best result using this shared decision-making model. This
interprofessional approach must use evidence-based medicine and a unique, integrated care pathway. The best
prognosis and outcome depend on the early recognition of potential complications.
