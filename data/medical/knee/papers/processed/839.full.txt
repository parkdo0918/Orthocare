Br J Sports Med2016; 50:839–843.INTRODUCTION
Patellofemoral pain (PFP) typically presents as
diffuse anterior knee pain, usually with activities
such as squatting, running, stair ascent and descent.
It is common in active individuals across the life-span,
1–4and is a frequent cause for presentation at
physiotherapy , general practice, orthopaedic andsports medicine clinics in particular.
56Its impact is
profound, often reducing the ability of those withPFP to perform sporting, physical activity andwork-related activities pain-free. Increasing evi-dence suggests that it is a recalcitrant condition,persisting for many years.
7–9In an attempt to share
recent innovations, build on the ﬁrst three success-
ful biennial retreats and de ﬁne the ‘state of the art’
for this common, impactful condition; the 4thInternational Patellofemoral Pain Research Retreatwas convened.
The 4th International Patellofemoral Research
Retreat was held in Manchester, UK, over 3 days(September 2 –4th, 2015). After undergoing peer-
review for scienti ﬁc merit and relevance to the
retreat, 67 abstracts were accepted for the retreat(50 podium presentations, and 17 short presenta-tions). The podium and short presentations weregrouped into ﬁve categories; (1) PFP , (2) factors
that in ﬂuence PFP (3) the trunk and lower extrem-
ity (4) interventions and (5) systematic analyses.
Three keynote speakers were chosen for their scien-tiﬁc contribution in the area of PFP . Professor
Andrew Amis spoke on the biomechanics of thepatellofemoral joint. Professor David Felson spokeon patellofemoral arthritis,
10and Dr Michael
Ratleff ’s keynote theme was PFP in the adolescent
patient.11As part of the retreat, we held structured,
whole-group discussions in order to develop con-
sensus relating to the work presented at the
meeting as well as evidence gathered from theliterature.
Consensus development process
In our past three International PatellofemoralResearch Retreats, we developed a consensus state-ment addressing different presentation categor-ies.
12–14In Manchester in 2015, we revised theformat. For the exercise and physical interventions,
we developed consensus based on reviews of sys-tematic reviews, and these are reported in a com-
panion publication.
15For factors contributing to
PFP , Professor Christopher Powers facilitated the
discussion and development of consensus, which ispublished in another companion publication. Forthe remaining topics of terminology, de ﬁnitions/
diagnosis and features of clinical examination, aconsensus discussion was led by KMC, with theresults described below.
In addition to the consensus activities, two sec-
tions that had been features of prior consensus meet-ings underwent an update and synthesis of literature.The evidence related to natural history of PFP andpatellofemoral osteoarthritis (OA) was described byJJS and KMC, while a recommendation on PROMsfor use in PFP was completed by NJC, DBJ andJFE, based on the best available evidence.
The following pages present the 4th
Patellofemoral Pain Consensus Statement regardingterminology, de ﬁnitions, clinical examination,
natural history , patellofemoral OA and patientreported outcomes (PROMs). These statementsrepresent the contemporary status of knowledge intheﬁeld of PFP and hence, will change over time.
This document was developed for clinicians andresearchers, to improve our comprehension of thisproblematic condition, and provide a guide forbetter and more consistent assessment and manage-ment. Additionally, gaps in current knowledge canbe identi ﬁed and provide a basis for future research
directions.
TERMINOLOGY
T wo terms were proposed for the condition: (1)
PFP and (2) patellofemoral arthropathy. PFP hasbeen used as the preferred term over recent years,however, it does not take into account how non-painful joint conditions could be a precursor topain development, does not include symptoms suchas crepitus, and may increase a focus on the ‘pain ’
aspect of the condition. The alternative term, patel-lofemoral arthropathy, was proposed, as part of theincreasing recognition that PFP may be a symptom

of joint disease. Focusing on the disease process (arthropathy)
might not be appropriate because: (A) the linkage betweendisease process and pain presentation is not clear, (B) pain is thepredominant symptom, and (C) it could shift the focus toimaging, rather than clinical outcomes.
Statement 1 .The term ‘patellofemoral pain ’is the preferred
term, and is a synonym for other terms including: (1) PFP syn-
drome; (2) chondromalacia patella; (3) anterior knee pain and/or syndrome; and (4) runner ’s knee.
DEFINING PFP
Statement 2. The core criterion required to de ﬁne PFP is pain
around or behind the patella, which is aggravated by at least oneactivity that loads the patellofemoral joint during weight bearingon a ﬂexed knee (eg, squatting, stair ambulation, jogging/
running, hopping/jumping).Additional criteria (not essential):A. Crepitus or grinding sensation emanating from the patellofe-
moral joint during knee ﬂexion movements
B. T enderness on patellar facet palpationC. Small effusionD. Pain on sitting, rising on sitting, or straightening the knee
following sitting
Statement 3. People with a history of dislocation, or whoreport perceptions of subluxation, should not be included instudies of PFP , unless the study is speci ﬁcally evaluating these
subgroups.
Currently, such patients are considered to be a subgroup of
people with patellofemoral disorders and/or pain, who mayhave distinct presentations, biomechanical risk factors andrequire different treatments approaches.
CLINICAL EXAMINATION OF PFP
Clinical examination is the cornerstone to diagnose PFP ,16 17
but there is no de ﬁnitive clinical test to diagnose PFP .18
Statement 4. The best available test is anterior knee pain elicitedduring a squatting manoeuvre: PFP is evident in 80% of peoplewho are positive on this test.
18
Additional tests (limited evidence):
T enderness on palpation of the patellar edges (PFP is evident
in 71 –75% of people with this ﬁnding.18
T ests with limited diagnostic usefulness
▸Patellar grinding and apprehension tests (eg, Clarke ’s test)
have low sensitivity and limited diagnostic accuracy forPFP .
18 19
▸Knee range of motion and effusion.
NATURAL HISTORY
Incidence and prevalence of PFP
Statement 5. PFP is common in young adolescents, with a
prevalence of 7 –28%,22 02 1and incidence of 9.2%.20
Few studies have evaluated prevalence or incidence in other
populations, except in the military,4where the annual incidence
in men is 3.8% and in women is 6.5%, with a prevalence of12% in men and 15% in women.
4
Specialisation in a single sport was associated with a relative
risk (1.5: 95% CI: 1.0 to 2.2) of PFP incidence compared tomultisport athletes.
2
PATELLOFEMORAL OSTEOARTHRITIS
Prevalence and impact of patellofemoral OA
Statement 6. Patellofemoral OA is an under recognised yet
important subgroup of knee OA.22 23Knee OA research has mainly focused on the tibiofemoral
compartment, yet recent evidence suggests that the patellofe-
moral compartment is at least as commonly affected by OA.24–26
Depending on the source population and de ﬁnition of OA (ie,
radiographic or MRI) isolated patellofemoral OA is present in
11–24% of older individuals and occurs in combination with
tibiofemoral OA in 4 –40% of people. People with patellofe-
moral OA exhibit similar patterns of pain and functional limita-
tion to those with PFP .27–31
Risk factors/factors associated with patellofemoral OA
Statement 7. A variety of factors may alter the mechanics of thepatellofemoral joint and increase joint stress, potentially leadingto OA.A. Abnormal patellofemoral joint alignment and trochlear
morphology are associated with patellofemoral OA (bothradiographic and MRI features). A recent systematicreview
32concluded that there is strong evidence that patel-
lofemoral OA is associated with both abnormal trochlearmorphology and frontal plane knee alignment. There is alsolimited evidence (due to the lack of longitudinal studies)that malalignment in the sagittal (patella alta) and axial(lateral patellar displacement and tilt) planes are associatedwith patellofemoral OA. However, there remains a knowl-edge gap regarding optimal measures and thresholds to bestpredict patellofemoral OA.
B. Muscle weakness: Quadriceps weakness is an important
factor in patellofemoral OA. Quadriceps function, such asmuscle size,
33strength34 35and muscle force,36is impaired
in people with patellofemoral OA. Importantly, quadricepsweakness is a risk factor for patellofemoral OA.
37W eakness
of muscle groups above the knee (involving the gluteii, oftenreferred to as the ‘proximal muscles ’) is well documented in
young individuals with non-arthritic PFP .
16 38 –42Emerging
evidence suggests that those with patellofemoral OA mayalso demonstrate proximal muscle dysfunction compared tocontrols, including lower gluteus minimus and medius peakmuscle force,
43and lower hip abductor strength.44These
studies found no differences in gluteus maximus peakmuscle force
43or hip external rotator strength.44In the
absence of longitudinal studies, the potential for hip muscleweakness to increase the risk of patellofemoral OA remainsunknown.
C. Abnormal biomechanics: There is recent evidence that indi-
viduals with patellofemoral OA demonstrate abnormal bio-mechanics during gait.
36 43 45 –47Fok et al36reported that
those with patellofemoral OA had lower knee extension
moments, quadriceps forces and patellofemoral joint reac-tion forces during stair ascent and descent. In contrast tothese ﬁndings, Pohl et al
44reported that pelvis, hip and
knee kinematics were not different between people with
patellofemoral OA and controls. In the only longitudinalstudy to date, T eng et al
48found that peak knee ﬂexion
moment and ﬂexion moment impulse at baseline lead to
progression of patellofemoral cartilage damage over 2 years.
Statement 8. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR)increases the risk of patellofemoral OA.
There is radiographic and MRI evidence of patellofemoral
OA following ACLR,
49–57which appears to be independent of
hamstring tendon or bone-patellar-bone autograft. Whilefurther longitudinal studies are required to elucidate themechanisms underpinning patellofemoral OA following ACLR,it may be related to altered biomechanics and concomitantchondral damage.
56 58Notably, patellofemoral OA following

ACLR is associated with worse symptoms and function57and
deteriorating symptoms.59
Relationship between structure and pain
Statement 9. The relationship between abnormal joint structure
and pain is imprecise. Patellofemoral pathology is traditionally
considered to occur in the lateral compartment, which appears
inconsistent with cartilage damage and bone marrow lesions(BMLs) on MRI (two hallmark features of OA on MRI) present-ing in the medial and lateral patellofemoral joint.
60 61An inter-
esting ﬁnding was that PFP was only present with lateral
patellofemoral joint damage and with concomitant medial andlateral structural damage, but not when there was only medialjoint damage.
61In a series of studies, Sharma et al62found that
PFJ cartilage damage and BMLs were associated with prevalent
frequent knee symptoms and incident persistent symptoms over5 years and that worsening of preradiographic patelofemoraldamage was associated with persistent knee symptoms.
63
Statement 10. The infrapatellar fat pad is an intracapsular andextrasynovial tissue that is highly innervated and a potentialcause of PFP .
The role of the fat pad in the patellofemoral OA disease
process remains unclear. In a cohort of people with patellofe-moral OA there was greater fat pad volume compared to con-trols, and greater fat pad volume was associated with greaterknee pain severity .
64In other cohorts of people with and
without OA, greater fat pad size was associated with greatermedial and lateral tibial and patellar cartilage volume,
65and
predicted lower knee pain at follow-up.66
Treatment of patellofemoral OA
Statement 11. Clinical features of patellofemoral OA may differfrom tibiofemoral OA.
It is possible that in order to target effective rehabilitation
treatments for those with patellofemoral OA, we need to recog-nise the clinical ﬁndings that identify and discriminate them
from tibiofemoral OA. Schiphof et al
67reported that the pres-
ence of crepitus in the knee and history of patellar pain weresigniﬁcantly associated with patellofemoral joint OA (but not
tibiofemoral joint OA) in women. Other studies reported poordiagnostic ability of a variety of clinical examination ﬁndings
self-reported knee pain location and with activities to discrimin-ate those with patellofemoral OA from those with tibiofemoralOA.
34 68This is an area requiring further investigation, as high-
lighted in the Felson editorial.10
Statement 12. A combined intervention69(ie, exercise therapy,
education, manual therapy and taping) or patellofemoral bracing70
may improve outcomes for people with patellofemoral OA.
Patellofemoral bracing may improve patellofemoral kinematics
and knee pain and shrink BMLs in those with patellofemoral
OA.70 71 72The only other study on patellofemoral bracing
found a small but non-signi ﬁcant effect on knee pain.73
PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME MEASURES
PROMs are used by researchers and clinicians to follow the
course of PFP and evaluate treatment outcomes. T ypically admi-nistered as questionnaires, PROMs measure the patient ’so w n
perspective of their PFP and treatment, without interpretationof their response by another individual. This minimises observerbias, and captures aspects of PFP that are likely to be importantto the patient.Statement 13. Researchers should use a standard set of PROMsfor PFP and OA to facilitate future comparisons and pooling ofdata.These should encompass three core clinical constructs: pain,
function and global assessment.
74Researchers may also choose
to evaluate quality of life and physical activity (optional con-structs). Speciﬁ c PROMs for each construct will be recom-
mended in an upcoming paper, based on a Delphi exercise.
It should be noted that few PROMs have been developed spe-
ciﬁcally for PFP , raising the possibility that PROMs commonly
used in research to date may lack content validity for thispatient population.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The reporting in studies of patients with PFP can limit theirknowledge translation and as a result, a Delphi exercise isunderway , to determine the minimum design and reporting stan-dards for PFP . The 5th International Patellofemoral PainResearch Retreat, will be held in Brisbane, Australia in July ,2017.
