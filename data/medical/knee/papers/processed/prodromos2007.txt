and a Knee Injury–Reduction Regimen

Purpose: The literature has shown that anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear rates vary by gender, by
sport, and in response to injury-reduction training programs. However, there is no consensus as to themagnitudes of these tear rates or their variations as a function of these variables. For example, thefemale-male ACL tear ratio has been reported to be as high as 9:1. Our purpose was to apply meta-analysisto the entire applicable literature to generate accurate estimates of the true incidences of ACL tear as afunction of gender, sport, and injury-reduction training. Methods: A PubMed literature search was done
to identify all studies dealing with ACL tear incidence. Bibliographic cross-referencing was done toidentify additional articles. Meta-analytic principles were applied to generate ACL incidences as afunction of gender, sport, and prior injury-reduction training. Results: Female-male ACL tear incidences
ratios were as follows: basketball, 3.5; soccer, 2.67; lacrosse, 1.18; and Alpine skiing, 1.0. The collegiatesoccer tear rate was 0.32 for female subjects and 0.12 for male subjects. For basketball, the rates were 0.29and 0.08, respectively. The rate for recreational Alpine skiers was 0.63, and that for experts was 0.03, withno gender variance. The two volleyball studies had no ACL tears. Training reduced the ACL tearincidence in soccer by 0.24 but did not reduce it at all in basketball. Conclusions: Female subjects had
a roughly 3 times greater incidence of ACL tears in soccer and basketball versus male subjects.Injury-reduction programs were effective for soccer but not basketball. Recreational Alpine skiers had thehighest incidences of ACL tear, whereas expert Alpine skiers had the lowest incidences. Volleyball mayin fact be a low-risk sport rather than a high-risk sport. Alpine skiers and lacrosse players had no genderdifference for ACL tear rate. Year-round female athletes who play soccer and basketball have an ACL tearrate of approximately 5%. Level of Evidence: Level IV, therapeutic case series. Key Words: Anterior
cruciate ligament tear—Incidence—Gender variance—Knee injury reduction.
It is estimated that there will be more than 100,000
anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears in the United
States this year.1The injury is usually quite painful.
Treatment commonly entails surgery and signiﬁcanttime lost from work and sports. For these and otherreasons, there is great interest in reducing the number
of ACL tears. It is commonly reported that femalesubjects have a greater incidence of ACL tear thanmale subjects. This has been estimated to be as muchas 8 to 9 times greater by sports medicine physi-cians.
2,3It is also commonly reported that dedicated
programs can reduce that incidence. Finally, varyingclaims are made as to which sports are high risk forACL tear. Widely disparate representations are madebecause there has been no systematic study of thesubject to establish what is really known.

incidence data are technical and confusing to deal
with, rendering cohesive understanding of the subjectdifﬁcult from a casual reading of the literature. Before
a problem can be adequately remedied, it is neces-sary to understand the nature of the problem. Webelieved that this subject lent itself well to meta-analysis. Therefore our purpose was to test thehypothesis that the incidence of ACL tears wouldshow variation by sport, gender, and effect of ACLtear–reduction training program.
METHODS
A PubMed computerized literature search was per-
formed to identify all English-language peer-reviewedresearch articles dealing with the incidence of ACLtears. A number of indexing terms were used toachieve this goal. The exact phrase “anterior cruciateligament” with either the keyword “incidence” or“rate” was used initially. Each individual sport withthe phrase “anterior cruciate ligament” was also in-dexed. We found 793 articles. Abstracts were thenreviewed of each of these to identify those that hadactual numeric data on the incidence of ACL tear.Reports that dealt with the incidence of ACL tearswere obtained based on their abstracts for review. Ofthese, 33 were found to have usable ACL tear inci-dence data and are the basis of this study. The gener-ally preferred and most commonly used method ofACL tear incidence measurement is “tears per 1,000exposures,” with an exposure being deﬁned as a prac-tice or a game. Of the 33 articles, 25 either reportedtheir data via this method or were able to have theirdata converted into this format for purposes of com-parison with other studies. The only exception to thisconvention is found in the Alpine skiing literature, inwhich a skier-day is used as an exposure. In all casesan exposure represents a usual day’s participation forthe given sport. These data are presented in Table 1
(online only, available at www.arthroscopyjournal.org ).
When conversions were made into the “tears per 1,000exposures” format from data not originally presentedthat way, the assumptions that were used to make theconversion are listed. Most commonly, this involvedconverting “tears per hour of competition” into tearsper exposure by converting hours into exposures byuse of the length of practices in hours and minutes tosubstitute. The data in Table 1 (online only, available
atwww.arthroscopyjournal.org ) are divided by sport
and then subdivided by level of competition (i.e., highschool or collegiate). Data from each subdivision level(e.g., high school soccer as a subdivision of soccer) werethen pooled in Table 2 (online only, available at www.
arthroscopyjournal.org ).Table 3 (online only, available
atwww.arthroscopyjournal.org ) lists the 8 studies that
reported incidence data but not in, or convertible to, the“tears per 1,000 exposures” format.
4-11Table 4 (online
only, available at www.arthroscopyjournal.org ) pools the
data from studies that compared female with male injuryrates. Only comparison studies were used, and weightedmeans were calculated for the female-male ratios thusobtained. Table 5 (online only, available at www.
arthroscopyjournal.org ) pools the data from studies
that compared athletes who had been trained in ACLinjury–reduction programs with athletes who had not.As with the female-male data, only comparison stud-ies were used here to compute weighted means.
Statistical Analysis
The data from all of the articles were ﬁrst pooled
together by generating weighted means for all ACLincidence rates by sport. We then used the
/H92732test to
compare weighted means across groups. The signiﬁ-
cance level was set at P/H11005.05. All statistical analysis
was performed with the S-PLUS program (Insightful,Seattle, WA).

29and Viola et al.30have rates of 0.02 and
0.04, respectively. The two studies of general popu-lation skiers by Warme et al.
31and Deibert et al.32

DISCUSSION
This is the only study to our knowledge that eval-
uates the overall relative risks of ACL tears as afunction of sport, gender, and injury-reduction train-ing. It is also the only study to use meta-analyticmethods to arrive at these conclusions for all threeparameters. The data analysis provides a number ofinteresting observations.
Before these observations are discussed, it should
be pointed out that there is great variation in thenumber of exposures among the available studies. Thelargest group had over 8 million exposures, whereasthe smallest had only 625. It is therefore imperativethat the reader always be cognizant of the number ofexposures attendant to given ACL tear incidence ratesbecause the reliability of the incidence is directlyproportional to the number of exposures. The meta-analytic method is particularly well suited to analyses1322 C. PRODROMOS ET AL.

in which such large variations exist because it weights
aggregated rates proportionately according to thenumber of exposures and thus minimizes the effect oflow exposure cohorts. Thus Table 2 (online only,
available at www.arthroscopyjournal.org ), which pro-
vides these weighted means, provides the most reli-able numbers. Although this weighting eliminates out-lier effects within groups of studies for a speciﬁcsport, it cannot eliminate this effect for comparisonsbetween sports when there are few exposures for oneof them.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury
Surveillance System provided the data for the largestudies of Arendt and Dick,
13Harmon and Dick,15
Agel et al.,12and Mihata et al.16These studies used
National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Sur-veillance System data from 1989-1993, 1989-1997,1989-2002, and 1989-2004, respectively. The injuryrates were quite similar among these large exposurestudies even though they look at different time peri-ods. For example, the basketball and soccer data are
dominated by the large exposure studies of Mihataet al., Agel et al., and Arendt and Dick. The female
injury rates for basketball were 0.28, 0.29, and 0.30from these 3 different studies, respectively. For soc-cer, the rates were 0.32, 0.33, and 0.31, respectively.For male subjects, the corresponding rates were 0.08,0.08, and 0.07 for basketball and 0.12, 0.12, and 0.13for soccer. The fact that this consistency was main-tained over time can best be interpreted as indicatinga very high level of reliability of these data. However,the rates for wrestling, volleyball, and indoor soccer,all of which are very high, have much lower reliabil-ity, given the very small number of exposures. Theremaining sports have intermediate numbers of expo-sures and thus intermediate reliability.
The female-to-male ACL injury rate has been the
aspect of ACL tear incidence that has attracted themost recent interest. The basketball ratio of 3.5 andsoccer ratio of 2.66, as described, give a reliablepicture of this relative risk. This roughly 3-fold genderdisparity is somewhat lower than the 6-fold increasedrisk that is often quoted. Rugby and handball alsoshowed signiﬁcantly increased risk among femalesubjects, though with less reliable numbers because ofthe smaller number of exposures.
It is interesting that alpine skiing had no difference
in injury rates between male and female subjects invery high exposure studies for both the ski lodgeemployee expert skiers and the general populationnon-expert skiers. We have no explanation for thislack of gender disparity. This would indicate, how-ever, that any injury-reduction efforts in snow skiing
would best be directed at both male and female sub-jects.
In addition, the overall skiing data showed snow
skiing to indeed be the high-risk sport that it is com-monly thought to be for the general public. The 0.49rate is the highest recorded for large exposure studies,especially given that half of the subjects are male.However, among the ski lodge employees, presum-ably expert skiers, the 0.03 rate is the lowest for anylarge exposure study. Both cohorts have very largeexposures, indicating high reliability. Thus the lowtear rate group beneﬁted dramatically from increasedskill in their sport without speciﬁc injury-reductiontraining. This obviously highlights the beneﬁt of nov-ice skiers obtaining proper instruction. In fact, thediminution in ACL tear incidence as a function of thisdifference in skill level is the largest such effect seenin the study. It should be pointed out, however, thatthe actual risk to recreational skiers, despite the highincidence, is actually quite low because most recre-ational skiers have very few exposures per year com-pared with those playing competitive organized sportssuch as soccer and basketball.
There was also no gender disparity regarding la-
crosse. It has been suggested that the carrying of thestick is in some way ACL-protective, but if so, itwould only be protective for female subjects becausethe 0.17 male rate is slightly higher than that found formale subjects in soccer, basketball, and football.
Despite the relatively small number of exposures,
we think it is potentially of interest that no volleyballACL tears occurred among 4 cohorts from studies by2 different groups. Volleyball is routinely classiﬁed asa “high-risk sport.”
41These data indicate that it may
be a much lower-risk sport for ACL tear than has beenpreviously thought.
Football, with a male injury rate of 0.11, had a very
similar rate to that of soccer, at 0.12, and basketball, at0.08. All 3 sports are subject to noncontact ACL tears.Football is often thought to have higher risk becauseits players are subject to a much higher risk of contactACL tear as well as noncontact tear. The fact that theoverall incidence in football is not higher indicatesthat the noncontact mechanism of injury is likelymuch more prevalent than the contact mechanism forACL tears overall.
Three separate soccer studies showed signiﬁcant re-
ductions in ACL tear rate as a result of speciﬁc injury-reduction training programs. Surprisingly, however, the
two basketball studies showed no reduction in tear rateand indeed both showed double-digit increases in tear1323 INCIDENCE OF ACL TEARS

rate. Although it is unlikely that the programs actually
signiﬁcantly increased tear rate, it would appear thatthe ACL tear–reduction training programs extant areeffective for soccer but ineffective for basketball.
The data in this study can be used to provide at least
a rough estimate of the overall chance of injury forhigh-risk sports. Hewett et al.
41found a 4.4% 1-year
incidence of ACL tear in a prospective study of suchfemale athletes. The combined college soccer andbasketball female ACL tear rate per 1,000 exposuresis roughly 0.3—that is, a given athlete would have a30% risk of ACL tear after 1,000 exposures. Year-round players easily participate in 167 exposures percalendar year; 167/1,000 (17%) multiplied by this30% risk equals 5%. Thus there may be roughly a 5%chance of ACL tear for a female high-level soccer/basketball athlete for each year of participation. Thisnumber is in reasonably close agreement with the4.4% ﬁgure of Hewett et al. The risk would be higheror lower depending on the actual number of expo-sures. We think this may be a reasonable ballparknumber that may be useful for counseling of athletesinterested in the risks of participation. If men areassumed to have one third this risk, this would trans-late to a roughly 1.7% yearly risk, again depending onthe number of exposures.
This report has many weaknesses inherent to a large
meta-analysis. Because the inclusion and exclusioncriteria vary from article to article, there is signiﬁcantselection bias. In addition, not all of the articles re-ported the incidence data in the same format; assump-tions were made that again may lead to bias. Also,most of the studies were retrospective studies. In ad-dition, we made assumptions as to the length of prac-tices and games in some cases, where noted, to allowthe comparison of data in the per-hour format to datain the preferred and more widely used per-exposureformat.
CONCLUSIONS
Female subjects had a roughly 3 times higher inci-
dence of ACL tears in soccer and basketball than malesubjects. Injury-reduction programs were effective forsoccer but not basketball. Recreational Alpine skiershad the highest incidences of ACL tear, whereas ex-pert Alpine skiers had the lowest incidences. Volley-ball may in fact be a low-risk sport rather than ahigh-risk sport. Alpine skiers and lacrosse players hadno gender difference for ACL tear rate. Year-roundfemale soccer and basketball athletes have an ACLtear rate of approximately 5% per year.REFERENCES
