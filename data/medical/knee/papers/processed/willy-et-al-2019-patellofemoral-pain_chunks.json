Clinicians should also use perfor -\nmance of other functional activities that load the patellofemoral \njoint (PF J) in a flexed position, such as stair climbing or descent, \nas diagnostic tests for PFP .\nBClinicians should make the diagnosis of PFP using the fol -\nlowing criteria: (1) the presence of retropatellar or peri -\npatellar pain, (2) reproduction of retropatellar or peripatellar pain \nwith squatting, stair climbing, prolonged sitting, or other func -\ntional activities loading the PF J in a flexed position, and (3) exclu -\nsion of all other conditions that may cause anterior knee pain, \nincluding tibiofemoral pathologies.\nCClinicians may use the patellar tilt test with the presence \nof hypomobility to support the diagnosis of PFP .\nCLASSIFICATION\nFGiven the absence of a previously established valid classi -\nfication system for PFP , the clinical practice guideline \ngroup proposes a classification consisting of 4 subcategories as -\nsociated with the International Classification of Functioning, Dis -\nability and Health. The proposed classification system is based \non published evidence. The subcategories are named according \nto predominant impairments previously documented in people \nwith PFP . Clinicians may consider using the proposed impair -\nment/function-based PFP classification system to guide patient/\nclient management.\nPFP IMPAIRMENT /FUNCTION-BASED \nCLASSIFICATION SUBCATEGORIES\n1. Overuse/ overload without other impairment: a subcategory of \nindividuals with PFP may have pain primarily due to overuse/\noverload. Classification into the overuse/ overload without other \nimpairment subcategory is made with a fair level of certainty \nwhen the patient presents with a history suggesting an increase \nin magnitude and/ or frequency of PF J loading at a rate that sur -\npasses the ability of his or her PF J tissues to recover.\n2. Muscle performance deficits: a subcategory of individuals \nwith PFP may respond favorably to hip and knee resistance \nexercises. Classification into the muscle performance deficits \nsubcategory is made with a fair level of certainty when the \npatient presents with lower extremity muscle performance \ndeficits in the hip and quadriceps.\n3. Movement coordination deficits: a subcategory of individuals \nwith PFP may respond favorably to gait retraining and move -ment re-education interventions leading to improvements in \nlower extremity kinematics and pain, suggesting the impor -\ntance of assessing dynamic knee valgus during movement. \nThe diagnosis of PFP with movement coordination deficits is \nmade with a fair level of certainty when the patient presents \nwith excessive or poorly controlled knee valgus during a dy -\nnamic task, but not necessarily due to weakness of the lower \nextremity musculature.\n4. Mobility impairments: a subcategory of individuals with \nPFP may have impairments related to either hypermobile \nor hypomobile structures. The diagnosis of PFP with mobil -\nity deficits is made with a fair level of certainty when the \npatient presents with higher than normal foot mobility and/\nor flexibility deficits of 1 or more of the following structures: \nhamstrings, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, soleus, lateral reti -\nnaculum, or iliotibial band.\nEXAMINATION – OUTCOME MEASURES: ACTIVITY \nLIMITATIONS/SELF-REPORT MEASURES\nAClinicians should use the Anterior Knee Pain Scale \n(AKPS), the patellofemoral pain and osteoarthritis sub -\nscale of the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score \n(KOOS-PF), or the visual analog scale (VAS) for activity or Eng \nand Pierrynowski Questionnaire (EPQ) to measure pain and func -\ntion in patients with PFP . In addition, clinicians should use the \nVAS for worst pain, VAS for usual pain, or the numeric pain-rating \nscale (NPRS) to measure pain. Clinicians should use one of the \ntranslations and cross-cultural adaptations with demonstrated \nvalidity, reliability, and responsiveness to change for patients in \ndifferent countries and for those requiring questionnaires in lan -\nguages other than English.\nEXAMINATION – ACTIVITY LIMITATIONS/\nPHYSICAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES\nBClinicians should administer appropriate clinical or field \ntests that reproduce pain and assess lower-limb move -\nment coordination, such as squatting, step-downs, and single-leg \nsquats. These tests can assess a patient’s baseline status relative \nto pain, function, and disability; global knee function; and chang -\nes in status throughout the course of treatment.\nEXAMINATION – ACTIVITY LIMITATIONS/\nPHYSICAL IMPAIRMENT MEASURES\nCWhen evaluating a patient with PFP over an episode of \ncare, clinicians may assess body structure and function, \nincluding measures of patellar provocation, patellar mobility, foot \nposition, hip and thigh muscle strength, and muscle length.Summary of Recommendations*\n Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy® \n Downloaded from www.jospt.org at on November 12, 2025.

However, caution should be exercised with this \nrecommendation, as the superiority of acupuncture over placebo \nor sham treatments is unknown. This recommendation should \nonly be incorporated in settings where acupuncture is within the \nscope of practice of physical therapy.\nINTERVENTIONS – MANUAL THERAPY \nAS A STAND-ALONE TREATMENT\nAClinicians should not use manual therapy, including lum -\nbar, knee, or patellofemoral manipulation/ mobilization, in \nisolation for patients with PFP .\nINTERVENTIONS – BIOPHYSICAL AGENTS\nBClinicians should not use biophysical agents, including ul -\ntrasound, cryotherapy, phonophoresis, iontophoresis, \nelectrical stimulation, and therapeutic laser, for the treatment of \npatients with PFP .\nINTERVENTIONS – PATIENT EDUCATION\nFClinicians may include specific patient education on load \nmanagement, body-weight management when appropri -\nate, the importance of adherence to active treatments like exer -\ncise therapy, biomechanics that may contribute to relative \noverload of the PF J, the evidence for various treatment options, \nand kinesiophobia. Patient education may improve compliance \nand adherence to active management and self-management \nstrategies, and is unlikely to have adverse effects.\nINTERVENTIONS – COMBINED INTERVENTIONS\nAClinicians should combine physical therapy interventions \nfor the treatment of patients with PFP , which results in su -\nperior outcomes compared with no treatment, flat shoe inserts, \nor foot orthoses alone in the short and medium term. Exercise \ntherapy is the critical component and should be the focus in any INTERVENTIONS – SPECIFIC MODES \nOF EXERCISE THERAPY\nAClinicians should include exercise therapy with combined \nhip- and knee-targeted exercises to reduce pain and im -\nprove patient-reported outcomes and functional performance in \nthe short, medium, and long term. Hip-targeted exercise therapy \nshould target the posterolateral hip musculature. Knee-targeted \nexercise therapy includes either weight-bearing (resisted squats) \nor non–weight-bearing (resisted knee extension) exercise, as both \nexercise techniques target the knee musculature. Preference to \nhip-targeted exercise over knee-targeted exercise may be given in \nthe early stages of treatment of PFP . Overall, the combination of \nhip- and knee-targeted exercises is preferred over solely knee-tar -\ngeted exercises to optimize outcomes in patients with PFP .\nINTERVENTIONS – PATELLAR TAPING\nBClinicians may use tailored patellar taping in combination \nwith exercise therapy to assist in immediate pain reduc -\ntion, and to enhance outcomes of exercise therapy in the short \nterm (4 weeks). Importantly, taping techniques may not be bene -\nficial in the longer term or when added to more intensive physical \ntherapy. T aping applied with the aim of enhancing muscle func -\ntion is not recommended.\nINTERVENTIONS – PATELLOFEMORAL \nKNEE ORTHOSES (BRACING)\nBClinicians should not prescribe patellofemoral knee  \northoses, including braces, sleeves, or straps, for patients \nwith PFP .\nINTERVENTIONS – FOOT ORTHOSES\nAClinicians should prescribe prefabricated foot orthoses \nfor patients with greater than normal pronation to reduce \npain, but only in the short term (up to 6 weeks). If prescribed, \nfoot orthoses should be combined with an exercise therapy pro -\ngram. There is insufficient evidence to recommend custom foot \northoses over prefabricated foot orthoses.\nINTERVENTIONS – BIOFEEDBACK\nBClinicians should not use electromyography-based bio -\nfeedback on medial vastii activity to augment knee-target -\ned (quadriceps) exercise therapy for the treatment of PFP .\nBClinicians should not use visual biofeedback on lower ex -\ntremity alignment during hip- and knee-targeted exercises \nfor the treatment of patients with PFP .\nINTERVENTIONS – RUNNING GAIT RETRAINING\nCClinicians may use gait retraining consisting of multiple \nsessions of cuing to adopt a forefoot-strike pattern (for \n Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy® \n Downloaded from www.jospt.org at on November 12, 2025.

Standards of care are deter -\nmined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individ -\nual patient and are subject to change as scientific knowledge \nand technology advance and patterns of care evolve. These \nparameters of practice should be considered guidelines only. \nAdherence to them will not ensure a successful outcome in \nevery patient, nor should they be construed as including all \nproper methods of care or excluding other acceptable meth -\nods of care aimed at the same results. The ultimate judgment \nregarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan \nmust be made based on clinician experience and expertise in \nlight of the clinical presentation of the patient, the available \nevidence, available diagnostic and treatment options, and the \npatient’s values, expectations, and preferences. However, we \nsuggest that significant departures from accepted guidelines \nshould be documented in the patient’s medical records at the \ntime the relevant clinical decision is made.\nSCOPE AND RATIONALE OF THE GUIDELINE\nPatellofemoral pain (PFP) is a common musculoskeletal-\nrelated condition that is characterized by insidious onset of \npoorly defined pain, localized to the anterior retropatellar \nand/or peripatellar region of the knee.80 The onset of symp -\ntoms can be slow or acutely develop with a worsening of pain \naccompanying lower-limb loading activities (eg, squatting, \nprolonged sitting, ascending/descending stairs, jumping, or \nrunning, especially with hills).154,234,254 Symptoms can restrict \nparticipation in physical activity, sports, and work.74 Symp -\ntoms can recur and can persist for years.74 Patients with PFP \nsymptoms frequently present to health care professionals for \ndiagnosis and treatment.74,277 This CPG will allow physical \ntherapists and other rehabilitation specialists to stay up to \ndate with evolving PFP knowledge and practices, and help \nthem to make evidence-based treatment decisions.166\nContent experts were appointed by the Academy of Ortho -\npaedic Physical Therapy, APTA, Inc to conduct a review of \nthe literature and to develop a PFP CPG as indicated by the \ncurrent state of the evidence in the field. The authors of this \nguideline worked with research librarians with expertise in \nsystematic reviews to perform a systematic search. The search \nwas for concepts associated with PFP in articles published \nsince 1960 related to classification, examination, and inter -vention strategies, consistent with previous guideline devel -\nopment methods related to ICF classification.184 Briefly, the \nfollowing databases were searched from 1960 to May 2018: \nMEDLINE (PubMed; 1960 to date), Scopus (Elsevier BV; \n1960 to date), CINAHL (EBSCO; 1960 to date), SPORTDis -\ncus (EBSCO; 1960 to date), Cochrane Library (Wiley; 1960 \nto date).

Articles that were authored by a reviewer were \nassigned to an alternate reviewer. Funding was provided to \nthe CPG development team for travel and expenses for CPG \ndevelopment training. The CPG development team main -\ntained editorial independence.\nArticles contributing to recommendations were reviewed \nbased on specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, with the \ngoal of identifying evidence relevant to physical therapist \nclinical decision making for adult persons with PFP. The title \nand abstract of each article were reviewed independently by \n2 members of the CPG development team for inclusion. See \nAPPENDIX C  for inclusion and exclusion criteria, available at \nwww.jospt.org . Full-text review was then similarly conducted \nto obtain the final set of articles for contribution to recom -\nmendations. The team leader (D.S.L.) provided the final deci -\nsion for discrepancies that were not resolved by the review \nteam. See APPENDIX D  for a flow chart of articles and APPENDIX E \nfor articles included in recommendations by topic, available \nat www.jospt.org . For selected relevant topics that were not \nappropriate to the development of recommendations, such \nas incidence and imaging, articles were not subject to the \nsystematic review process and were not included in the flow \nchart. Evidence tables for this CPG are available on the Clini -\ncal Practice Guidelines page of the Academy of Orthopaedic \nPhysical Therapy, APTA, Inc website ( www.orthopt.org ).\nThis guideline was issued in 2019 based on the published \nliterature up to May 2018. This guideline will be considered \nfor review in 2024, or sooner if new evidence becomes avail -\nable. Any updates to the guideline in the interim period will \nbe noted on the Academy of Orthopaedic Physical Therapy, \nAPTA, Inc website ( www.orthopt.org ).\nLEVELS OF EVIDENCE\nIndividual clinical research articles were graded accord -\ning to criteria adapted from the Centre for Evidence-Based \nMedicine, Oxford, United Kingdom for diagnostic, prospec -\ntive, and therapeutic studies.229 In 3 teams of 2, each review -\ner independently assigned a level of evidence and evaluated \nthe quality of each article using a critical appraisal tool. See \nAPPENDICES F and G for the evidence table and details on pro -\ncedures used for assigning levels of evidence, available at \nwww.jospt.org . The evidence update was organized from \nhighest level of evidence to lowest level. An abbreviated \nversion of the grading system is provided as follows.IEvidence obtained from high-quality diagnostic studies, prospec -\ntive studies, randomized controlled trials, or systematic reviews\nIIEvidence obtained from lesser-quality diagnostic studies, pro -\nspective studies, systematic reviews, or randomized controlled \ntrials (eg, weaker diagnostic criteria and reference standards, \nimproper randomization, no blinding, less than 80% follow-up)\nIII Case-control studies or retrospective studies\nIV Case series\nV Expert opinion\nSTRENGTH OF EVIDENCE AND GRADES OF RECOMMENDATION\nThe strength of the evidence supporting the recommendations \nwas graded according to the previously established methods \nprovided below. Each team developed recommendations based \non the strength of evidence, including how directly the studies \naddressed the question in the PFP population. In developing \ntheir recommendations, the authors considered the strengths \nand limitations of the body of evidence, and the health ben -\nefits, side effects, and risks of tests and interventions.\nGRADES OF RECOMMENDATION STRENGTH OF EVIDENCE\nAStrong evidence A preponderance of level I and/ or level II \nstudies support the recommendation. This \nmust include at least 1 level I study\nBModerate  \nevidenceA single high-quality randomized controlled \ntrial or a preponderance of level II studies \nsupport the recommendation\nCWeak evidence A single level II study or a preponderance of \nlevel III and IV studies, including statements \nof consensus by content experts, support the \nrecommendation\nDConflicting  \nevidenceHigher-quality studies conducted on this \ntopic disagree with respect to their conclu -\nsions.

The \npatella is a large sesamoid bone embedded in the quadriceps \nextensor mechanism. The roles of the patella are to increase \nthe moment arm of the quadriceps muscles, provide bony \nprotection to the distal joint surfaces of the femoral condyles \nwhen the knee is flexed, and prevent damaging compressive \nforces on the quadriceps tendon with resisted knee extension.\nClinical Presentation\nPatellofemoral pain is a common musculoskeletal-related \ncondition that is characterized by insidious onset of poorly \ndefined pain quality localized to the anterior retropatellar \nand/or peripatellar region of the knee.80 The onset of symp -\ntoms can be slow or acutely develop, with a worsening of pain \nwith lower-limb loading (eg, squatting, prolonged sitting, as -\ncending/descending stairs, jumping, or running, especially \nwith hills).154,234,254 While many pathoanatomic correlates, \nsuch as internal derangement or cartilage softening, have \nbeen offered from as early as 1928,106 all are poorly associated \nwith symptoms.94,254,288,291 Therefore, diagnosis is based on a \ncluster of signs and symptoms after ruling out other patho -\nanatomic diagnoses.205 Because there is typically a progres -\nsive, insidious onset of symptoms, diagnosis is often delayed, \nand describing the typical clinical course is difficult.\nPain\nCollins et al61 conducted a retrospective review of 4 separate \nstudies on the presence of symptoms in 459 individuals with \nPFP. They found that a large majority of these individuals re -\nported at least some difficulty with squatting (93.7%), stair \nnegotiation (91.2%), and running (90.8%).61 People with PFP \ntend to ascend and descend stairs with reduced knee flexion, CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nImpairment/Function-Based  \nDiagnosis\nPREVALENCE AND INCIDENCE\nPrevalence ranges from 3% to 85% for idiopathic anterior \nknee pain (AKP) or PFP and its associated diagnoses,41,207,216 \nwith a prevalence of 25% being the most frequently cited.41 \nAn analysis of the PearlDiver record database (a large na -\ntional database of orthopaedic conditions) reported a preva -\nlence of PFP diagnoses between 1.5% and 7.3% of all patients \nseeking medical care.119\nPatellofemoral pain occurs across the life span, from young \nchildren to older sedentary individuals.41 The highest prev -\nalence of PFP appears to be observed in those between 12 \nand 19 years of age,41,310 but may be dependent on activity \nlevel and environmental context. However, these percent -\nages are in contrast to the PearlDiver data analysis, which \nreported the highest percentage of PFP diagnosis in the \n50-to-59-year age group.119 The discrepancy in prevalence \nrelated to age may be due to an environmental context, \nsuch as treatment in a sports clinic versus in a general \npractice office.119\nVarying differences in prevalence by sex have been reported. \nGlaviano et al119 reported that 55% of patients with PFP in \nthe PearlDiver database were female. Boling et al32 reported \na prevalence of 15% in female naval cadets, compared to 12% \nin male naval cadets, at the US Naval Academy, whereas Lak -\nstein et al170 reported a prevalence of 2.39% in female Israel \nDefense Force recruits compared to 4.56% in male Israel \nDefense Force recruits. The overall incidence rate for PFP in \nUS naval cadets was 22/1000 person-years,32 and in military \nrecruits was 0.22/1000 training hours.151 The incidence rate \nfor PFP in US naval cadets was greater in women compared \nto men (33/1000 person-years and 15/1000 person-years, \nrespectively).32 In adolescent female athletes, the cumula -\ntive incidence risk and rate for the development of new uni -\nlateral PFP were 9.66 per 100 athletes and 1.09 per 1000 \nathletic exposures, respectively.203 Tenforde et al278 reported \na lifetime prevalence of PFP in high school runners to be \n21% in females and 16% in males. The recurrence of PFP is \nalarmingly high, with reports of 70% to 90% having recur -\nrent symptoms.270 Additionally, recent reports indicate that \nmore than 50% of individuals diagnosed with PFP will report \nunfavorable outcomes 5 to 8 years following enrollment into \na clinical trial.174\n Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy® \n Downloaded from www.jospt.org at on November 12, 2025.

The results of \nthe meta-analysis by Lankhorst et al173 suggested that quad -\nriceps strength, as measured with a dynamometer, was con -\nsiderably less when compared to healthy control individuals.\nQuadriceps atrophy is also a common finding in individuals \nwith PFP, but only when it is evaluated by imaging, not by \ngirth or visual assessment.116 Quadriceps atrophy is consistent \nacross the vastii musculature (ie, not isolated to the vastus \nmedialis oblique musculature).116 Thomeé and colleagues283 \nfound quadriceps inhibition (inability of the central nervous \nsystem to fully activate the quadriceps) of roughly 18% when \nassessed with surface electromyography (EMG), suggesting \nthat at least some of the loss of quadriceps strength is due \nto inhibited central neural drive. This may be partly due to \nthe pain generated from the PFJ through arthrogenic inhi -\nbition. With respect to quadriceps atrophy and inhibition, \nit is important to note that all studies listed above included \nindividuals with current signs and symptoms of PFP.\nDecreased Hip Force Production\nPeople with PFP have weakness of the hip abductors, exten -\nsors, and external rotators.194,241,286 Rate of force development \nof the hip abductors and extensors is also reduced in people \nwith PFP.214 However, in a systematic review with meta-anal -\nysis, Rathleff et al245 attempted to determine whether isomet -\nric hip strength was a definitive cause or a result of PFP by \ncomparing outcomes of 21 cross-sectional and 3 prospective \nstudies.245 The authors of the 3 prospective studies reported \nno association between hip strength and the development of \nPFP. The cross-sectional studies indicated small differences \nbetween people with and without PFP for hip abduction, ex -\ntension, external rotation, internal rotation, and adduction. \nThere is a strong possibility that hip weakness is a result of \nPFP, and not a direct cause of PFP.245\nBiomechanics\nAltered biomechanics are commonly observed during func -\ntional movements in people with PFP. People with PFP may \nwalk, run,89,238 and negotiate stairs87 with reduced knee flexion \ncompared to healthy controls, which may represent a com -\npensation pattern. Clinically, patients with PFP often present \nwith an increased frontal plane projection angle (FPPA; a \n2-dimensional surrogate for the 3-D measures of hip adduc -\ntion, hip internal rotation, knee abduction, and knee external \nrotation) during single-leg squat (SLS)134,307 and during a hop \nlanding.134 Athletes who tend to move excessively into great -\ner FPPAs during a jump landing are more likely to develop \nPFP.142 Distally, altered foot and ankle biomechanics are not \nconsistently observed in people with PFP.240\nPain Sensitization\nA systematic review by De Oliveira Silva et al88 examined the and there is some debate as to whether this is consistently seen \nin level walking.72 More than half (54.4%) of people with PFP \nreported pain with prolonged sitting; another 26.4% reported \npain with sitting after exercise. Only 19.2% of people could sit \nwithout pain.61 Pain with prolonged sitting had low to moder -\nate diagnostic accuracy in an earlier systematic review.64\nA systematic review of reviews concluded that AKP produced \nby functional tasks such as squatting, stair climbing, and sit -\nting with flexed knees is currently the best diagnostic indica -\ntor of PFP.222\nSandow and Goodfellow254 found less frequent reports of \nsymptoms with functional tasks in their long-term follow-up \nof about 4 years, with 50% of participants reporting PFP on \na weekly or more frequent basis. Half of the cohort reported \npain with stair climbing and 39% with sport participation at \nthe 4-year follow-up. Although symptoms of PFP may become \nless frequent over time, 94% still reported some degree of PFP, \neither at rest or with other activities such as walking. Pain dur -\ning running was not assessed.254 Sandow and Goodfellow254 \nalso reported that nearly 50% of their cohort had bilateral PFP.\nPeople with PFP demonstrate some common clinical char -\nacteristics. Often, patients report pain with palpation of the \ndistal pole or medial aspect of the patella, the medial plica, \nand the medial femoral condyle.113,210 There may be pain with \ngrinding or compressing of the patella.\nAnthropometrics\nPatient characteristics, anthropometrics, and patellofemoral \nalignment are often postulated as important factors in the \ndevelopment of PFP. However, a recent systematic review of \nobservational studies concluded that age, body mass, height, \nand body mass index (BMI) were not risk factors for the de -\nvelopment of PFP.173 Specific to lower extremity structure, the \nquadriceps angle (Q angle), assessed either in weight bearing \nor non–weight bearing, was not a risk factor for the develop -\nment of PFP.173,223\nPatellofemoral pain is often believed to be related to excessive \nfoot pronation; however, to date, only 1 study has shown that \ngreater navicular drop was associated with, and predictive of, \nthe development of PFP in a military cohort.34 Overall, exces -\nsive foot pronation does not appear to be a feature across \nstudies examining individuals with PFP.\nDecreased Thigh Force Production\nCompared with healthy, matched controls, people who devel -\nop PFP have weaker quadriceps, as measured by a dynamom -\neter. However, quadriceps weakness has only been found to \nbe a risk factor for the development of PFP in military popu -\nlations.173 Impaired lower extremity muscle function is com -\n Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy® \n Downloaded from www.jospt.org at on November 12, 2025.

In the individuals who received medical ad -\nvice from a physician, 68% reported no improvement after 3 \nmonths, and 54% reported no improvement after 12 months.\nPFP and Patellofemoral Osteoarthritis\nA link between PFP and patellofemoral osteoarthritis \n(PFOA) has been suggested.69,74,140,141,320 Patellofemoral pain \nand PFOA have similar presentations, including location of \npain, quadriceps and hip muscle weakness, and reported pain \nand difficulty with similar activities (eg, stair climbing and \nprolonged sitting). However, long-term prospective data are \npresently lacking to confirm or refute this link,69,320 with a \nrecent consensus statement concluding that insufficient evi -\ndence exists to conclusively link a past history of PFP with \nPFOA.293 However, there is retrospective evidence of a rela -\ntionship between previous history of PFP and the presence \nof PFOA later in life. Thomas et al282 conducted a systematic \nreview examining the link between a history of PFP as an \nadolescent or young adult and subsequent development of \nPFOA. This systematic review included 6 prospective studies, \nfollow-ups of 5 case series and 1 randomized controlled trial \n(RCT), and 1 retrospective case-control study. Only the retro -\nspective study specifically aimed to examine the link between \nPFP and PFOA later in life.285 The prospective studies were \nof low quality due to small sample size, low follow-up rates, \ninclusion of PFP due to trauma, and lack of control groups. \nThe evidence for a link between PFP and development of \nPFOA was limited to 1 retrospective case-control study by \nUtting et al,285 who compared the history of individuals who \nhad a patellofemoral arthroplasty for PFOA to those who had \na unicompartmental tibiofemoral arthroplasty. Those under -\ngoing patellofemoral arthroplasty (n = 118) more frequently \nrecalled a history of PFP (22% versus 6%), patellar instability \n(14% versus 1%), and patellar trauma (16% versus 6%) com -\npared to those undergoing unicompartmental tibiofemoral \narthroplasty (n = 116).\nConchie et al62 conducted a retrospective case-control study \nto determine the prevalence of AKP and patellar dislocation \nin persons undergoing patellofemoral arthroplasty for se -\nvere, isolated PFOA (n = 190) compared to persons (n = 445) \nundergoing unicompartmental tibiofemoral arthroplasty \nfor severe medial tibiofemoral osteoarthritis (OA). Of these \ngroups, 111 (58%) people with PFOA and 234 (53%) people \nin the unicompartmental tibiofemoral arthroplasty control \ngroup participated. A multivariate binary regression analy -\nsis found significantly greater association between adolescent \nAKP and PFOA (odds ratio [OR] = 7.5; 95% CI: 1.51, 36.94). \nAdditional significant associations were found for history of \npatellar dislocation (OR = 3.2; 95% CI: 1.25, 8.18), patellar association of pain sensitization in patients with PFP (n = \n315). They reviewed 9 studies that included 315 participants \nwith PFP and 164 healthy controls. They reported that in 5 \nstudies, patients with PFP were more sensitized (lower pres -\nsure pain thresholds) to a local pressure stimulus (standard -\nized mean difference [SMD], –1.12; 95% confidence interval \n[CI]: –1.48, –0.75) and a stimulus at a remote location (SMD, \n–0.93; 95% CI: –1.19, –0.67) compared to healthy controls. \nHowever, patients with PFP were no more sensitive to heat \nor cold compared to healthy controls.\nRate of Recurrence of PFP\nBased on the results of a few longitudinal studies, PFP is as -\nsociated with a high rate of chronicity, even after nonsurgical \ncare. Sandow and Goodfellow254 followed 54 adolescent girls \nfor 2 to 8 years after diagnosis of PFP. At an average of about \n4 years after diagnosis, 94% were still experiencing some \nform of pain, with less than half (46%) having a decrease \nin pain severity. Nimon and colleagues211 followed this same \ncohort via questionnaires for 14 to 20 years. At the long-term \nfollow-up, only 22% had no pain, but 71% had less pain than \nat initial presentation. From the individuals who completed \nthe questionnaires at both 2 to 8 years and 14 to 20 years, the \nauthors concluded that there are likely to be improvements in \n50% of cases within the first 4 years, and an additional 23% \nin the next 12; however, they were not able to predict who \nwould not improve.211\nBlond and Hansen29 reported an average of 6-year follow-up \nof 250 athletes diagnosed with PFP who were prescribed a \nself-training program for the lower extremity. About a quar -\nter (27%) of athletes experienced complete pain relief, and an \nadditional 38% had decreased pain, leaving 35% with pain \nthat was either unchanged or worse.\nKannus and Niittymäki154 attempted to identify predictors \nof people who would benefit from nonsurgical treatment of \nPFP. Of the 49 patients treated with avoidance of aggravating \nactivity, quadriceps isometric exercises, stretching exercises, \nand nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, 36 (73%) experi -\nenced resolution of symptoms.152 Only being younger was \npredictive of improving pain, Lysholm scores, and activity.154 \nOverall, these results indicate that attempts to improve the \nfunction of the quadriceps and remove aggravating factors \nare likely beneficial in the treatment of PFP.152 At a 7-year \nfollow-up of these same individuals, there were few changes \nin patient-reported and performance-based functions (quad -\nriceps strength, squatting, hopping, duck walking); however, \nphysical signs of pain with patellar compression, Clarke’s test, \nand crepitus during patellar compression increased from 6 \nmonths to 7 years.153 Finally, about a quarter of individuals \ndeveloped symptoms in the contralateral knee during the \n7-year follow-up.153\n Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy® \n Downloaded from www.jospt.org at on November 12, 2025.

An overall PFP incidence of 28% was reported in 546 \nfemale adolescent basketball, soccer, and volleyball players \nconsisting of 357 multisport and 189 single-sport athletes. \nParticipation in a single sport (basketball, soccer, or volley -\nball) was associated with a greater incidence of cumulative \nPFP disorders (incidence rate ratio = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.0, 2.2) \ncompared to participation in multiple sports.\nIVvan Middelkoop et al294 investigated differences in \ncharacteristics between adolescents (n = 20) and \nadults (n = 44) with PFP. At baseline, adolescents \nwith lower BMI had greater quadriceps strength and report -\ned more bilateral PFP symptoms compared to adults. Both \ngroups had similar hip strength and reported similar levels \nof pain at rest and during activity and self-reported knee \nfunction. At 1-year follow-up, adolescents and adults had \nsimilar levels of pain, self-reported knee function, and medi -\ncal consumption.

The Q angle, static knee valgus, and dy -\nnamic measures of knee valgus were not predictive of PFP. \nAn additional cross-sectional study that was not reported \nin the systematic review also reported no association be -\ntween Q angle and peak knee abduction moment in healthy \nrunners with PFP.224\nIIA prospective study of college-aged physical educa -\ntion students found an association of decreased \nquadriceps flexibility, shorter reflex response time \nof the vastus medialis oblique muscle, reduction of vertical \njump height, and higher than normal medial patellar mobil -\nity with occurrence of PFP.313\nIIIA literature review suggests that weakness in func -\ntional testing was coincident with tightness of the \nhamstring muscles, quadriceps muscles, and ilio -\ntibial band with AKP conditions (which included tendinopa -\nthies).298 No coincident relationship was reported between \npatellar mobility and PFP in the articles retrieved in their \nsearch.instability (OR = 3.5; 95% CI: 1.62, 7.42), and previous sur -\ngery (adjusted OR = 3.5; 95% CI: 1.75, 7.14).\nHinman and colleagues137 compared the presence of radio -\ngraphic PFOA and tibiofemoral OA in 224 individuals who \nhad chronic PFP who were older than 40 years of age. Isolated \nPFOA was present in 25% of the sample, combined PFOA and \ntibiofemoral OA was present in 44%, and isolated tibiofemo -\nral OA was present in only 1% of the sample. Only 30% of this \nsample with chronic PFP had no evidence of radiographic OA.137\nSchiphof et al255 examined 1518 knees of women over 45 years \nof age that had either no OA or only early signs of OA of the \nPFJ. Cartilage defects were present in 15% of these PFJs, 25% \nhad osteophytes, 13% had cysts, and 19% had bone marrow \nlesions. A history of PFP (25% of the sample) was associated \nwith current cartilage lesions, cartilage cysts, and bone mar -\nrow lesions.255\nSummary\nPatellofemoral pain has a variable clinical presentation but \nis generally associated with AKP exacerbations when loading \nthe PFJ in squatting, participation in sports, stair negotiation, \nprolonged sitting, and walking. Decreased knee extensor and \nhip musculature strength is associated with PFP compared \nto those without PFP. The most frequently cited predictors \nof poor outcomes are longer duration of symptoms before \nintervention, overall poorer function, and worse pain. Nega -\ntive psychological stress and altered pain sensitization were \npresent in patients with PFP. For the majority of patients, \nthe “educate and wait” approach of avoiding pain-provoking \nactivities is not effective in improving pain and function in \nthe short, medium, or long term. It appears that PFP and \nPFOA may be related; however, there is insufficient evidence \nto directly state a cause-and-effect relationship.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe etiology of PFP is poorly understood and considered to \nbe multifactorial. Frequently, development and persistence of \nsymptoms are attributed to proximal, distal, or local factors \nthat increase or alter load/stress to the PFJ, and there is a \nlarge body of research in this area. More recently, nonphysical \ninfluences on symptoms have been explored, with emerging \nevidence that factors such as pain sensitization and psycho -\nlogical state may play roles in PFP.\nDemographics\nIA systematic review with a meta-analysis of 7 pro -\nspective studies reported on anthropometrics and \nthe development of PFP.223 In 6 studies with 905 \nhealthy controls and 177 people with PFP, height, weight, and \npercentage body fat were not predictive of PFP.\n Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy® \n Downloaded from www.jospt.org at on November 12, 2025.

For quadriceps girth measurements, the SMD between \nthe limb with PFP and the control limb was –0.084 (95% CI: \n–0.44, 0.27), indicating no differences. For imaging measure -\nments of quadriceps muscle size, the SMD was –0.44 (95% \nCI: –0.86, –0.029), indicating quadriceps atrophy in the limb \nwith PFP.\nIIVan Tiggelen et al295 investigated the role of muscle \nstrength as a predisposing factor in the develop -\nment of PFP. Thirty-one out of 96 male military \nrecruits developed PFP after a strenuous military training \nprogram (8-12 h/d for 6 weeks). Recruits who developed PFP \nwere shorter in height or had lower knee extensor strength \ncompared to those who did not develop PFP.\nIIIIn a case-control study, 25 women with PFP and 25 \nasymptomatic women with PFP had between 11.1% \nand 30.7% inferior knee extensor, hip extensor, hip \nabductor, and hip external rotator strength compared to as -\nymptomatic women. Women with PFP had greater center-of-\npressure (COP) displacement and velocity during a step-up \nand step-down task compared to the asymptomatic \nwomen.85\nIIIGuney et al124 investigated the quadriceps-to-ham -\nstrings strength ratio in 44 women with unilateral \nPFP (using the contralateral limb as the control). \nAt 60°/s and 180°/s for the concentric quadriceps-to-con -\ncentric hamstrings ratio, the limb with PFP had mean ± SD \nratios of 1.18 ± 0.21 and 1.02 ± 0.44, respectively, and the \ncontrol limb had ratios of 1.36 ± 0.57 and 1.35 ± 0.32, re -\nspectively. At 60°/s and 180°/s for the eccentric quadriceps-\nto-concentric hamstrings ratio, the limb with PFP had \nratios of 1.19 ± 0.23 and 2.56 ± 0.49, respectively, and the \ncontrol limb had ratios of 1.55 ± 0.59 and 2.86 ± 0.91, \nrespectively.\nIIIA cross-sectional analysis of an RCT was performed \nto identify characteristics of men and women who \nresponded to a 6-week hip- or knee-based rehabili -\ntation program. Improvement was defined by either a mini -\nmum of a 2-cm reduction on a visual analog scale (VAS) for \npain or at least an 8-point improvement in function on the \nAnterior Knee Pain Scale (AKPS). Men and women improved \nafter completing both the hip- and the knee-based exercise \nprograms. Those who responded to either exercise program \nhad lower baseline hip and knee muscle strength compared \nto the nonresponders.31IIIHoglund et al139 compared isometric hip strength \nin 36 men with and 36 men without PFP. Men with \nPFP had weaker hip extensors, but there were no \ndifferences between groups in hip abductor or external rota -\ntor strength.\nPatellofemoral Characteristics\nIIICarlson et al44 used magnetic resonance imaging \n(MRI) to investigate the distance between the tibial \ntubercle and the femoral trochlear groove in a co -\nhort of 50 knees (38 participants) with PFP and 60 (56 par -\nticipants) asymptomatic knees. The distance between the \ntibial tubercle and the trochlear groove in fully extended \nknees for participants with PFP was a mean ± SD of 13.0 ± \n3.6 mm, compared to 10.8 ± 3.0 mm for asymptomatic con -\ntrols. Thirty percent of participants with PFP had distances \nbetween the tibial tubercle and the trochlear groove greater \nthan 15 mm, compared to 5% of asymptomatic controls.\nIIIAysin et al12 used MRI to investigate the trochlear \nsulcus angle, the trochlear sulcus depth, a ratio of \npatellar tendon length to the longest diagonal di -\nameter of the patella (Insall-Salvati ratio), and lateral patel -\nlofemoral angle in 38 people with PFP and chondromalacia \npatellae (CMP) diagnosed by imaging. Although those with \nmore advanced CMP reported higher pain severity and lower \nknee function compared to those with early CMP, there were \nno differences in MRI measures.\nProximal Factors\nITrunk and hip mechanics and impairments have \nbeen implicated as factors in the development and \npersistence of PFP. Based on 3 high-quality pro -\nspective studies included in the systematic review by Rathleff \net al,245 there is moderate to strong evidence that no associa -\ntion exists between lower isometric strength of the hip abduc -\ntors, extensors, external rotators, or internal rotators and the \nrisk of developing PFP. In contrast, the results of multiple (n \n= 21) cross-sectional studies from this same systematic re -\nview provide moderate to strong evidence that individuals \nwith PFP have lower isometric strength of the hip \nmusculature.245\nIIAmong studies that have exclusively looked at run -\nners, the contribution of hip weakness is not clear. \nOne systematic review of 2 cross-sectional studies \nand 1 prospective study found conflicting results for the rela -\ntionship between hip abductor weakness and the presence of \nPFP.199 A different systematic review of cross-sectional and \ncase-control studies reported a reduction in duration of glu -\nteus medius activation, measured using EMG signal inten -\nsity, in runners with PFP.264 A prospective cohort study \nreported a lower risk for development of PFP in runners with \n Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy® \n Downloaded from www.jospt.org at on November 12, 2025.

Another prospective study found \nthat high school runners with the weakest hip abductor \nstrength had a higher incidence of PFP.185\nIIAn earlier meta-analysis of 10 cross-sectional stud -\nies by Van Cant et al286 reported deficits in isometric \nhip abduction, extension, external rotation, and \nflexion in people with PFP compared to healthy participants. \nAmong studies that used the unaffected side for comparison, \n2 studies reported deficits in hip abduction and 1 study re -\nported deficits in hip extension and hip external rotation for \nthe side with PFP.\nIIIIn a cross-sectional study, Nunes et al214 compared \nthe rate of force development and isometric \nstrength of the hip abductor and extensor muscle \ngroups in 54 (27 with PFP, 27 healthy) physically active wom -\nen. The rate of force development was assessed for time to \nreach 30%, 60%, and 90% of peak isometric torque. Women \nwith PFP had 10% weaker hip abductors (effect size, 0.61) \nand 15% weaker hip extensors (effect size, 0.76) than knee-\nhealthy women. Their rate of force development for hip ab -\nductors was moderately slower than knee-healthy women for \nthe time to reach 60% (effect size, 0.50) and 90% (effect size, \n0.59) of peak isometric torque. The rate of force development \nfor the hip extensors in women with PFP was markedly slow -\ner in the time to reach 30% (effect size, 0.97) and 60% (effect \nsize, 0.81) of peak isometric torque.\nIIIMcMoreland et al191 examined hip isometric \nstrength and hip concentric muscle endurance in \nyoung women with mild PFP (n = 12) compared to \nage- and sex-matched controls (n = 12). They reported no \ndifferences in peak torque (isometric strength) and total work \n(endurance) for the hip abductors, external rotators, and in -\nternal rotators.\nIIIA case-control study by Van Cant et al287 evaluated \nmuscle endurance of the hip abductors, trunk ex -\ntensors, and ankle plantar flexors in women with \nPFP (n = 20) compared to healthy controls (n = 76). Women \nwith PFP had 16% weaker hip abductors, 14% weaker trunk \nextensors, and 26% weaker ankle plantar flexors compared \nto knee-healthy women.\nIIISteinberg et al271 identified factors associated with \nPFP in youth dancers. Dancers aged 10 to 11 years \nwith PFP were more likely to have less hip abduc -\ntion range of motion (ROM) (OR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.99) \nand less low back and hamstring flexibility (OR = 3.54; 95% \nCI: 1.02, 12.28). In dancers aged 12 to 14 years, those with PFP were more likely to have less ankle dorsiflexion ROM \n(OR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.99), less hindfoot varum (OR = \n0.26), and greater patellar mobility (OR = 2.67; 95% CI: 1.14, \n6.35). In dancers aged 15 to 16 years, those with PFP were \nmore likely to have scoliosis (OR = 5.21; 95% CI: 1.35, 20.05) \nand greater ankle plantar flexion and hip internal rotation \nROM (OR = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.1).\nDistal Factors\nIILankhorst et al172 performed a systematic review of \n7 case-control or cross-sectional studies of static foot \nmeasures. Arch height index was not associated with \nPFP. The numbers of people with PFP with pes cavus or pes \nplanus were not different from knee-healthy controls.\nIIThe systematic review of 24 studies (3 prospective \ncohorts, 17 case-controls, and 4 case series) by \nWaryasz and McDermott298 reported no association \nbetween foot alignment (pes cavus or pes planus) and PFP. \nGastrocnemius tightness was reported in patients with PFP \ncompared to controls in 2 of 3 studies.\nIIA systematic review of 24 case-control studies by \nBarton et al20 reported that slower rate of time to \npeak rearfoot eversion and a greater amount of \nrearfoot eversion at initial heel contact during walking were \ncharacteristic of patients with PFP. Patients with PFP exhib -\nited less rearfoot eversion motion during running.\nIINeal et al207 performed a systematic review of 4 \nstudies investigating foot posture as a risk factor for \nthe development of PFP. Navicular drop, measured \nas a continuous variable, was a risk factor for developing PFP \n(SMD, 0.33; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.65). When navicular drop was \ncharacterized as a dichotomous variable, pooled data indi -\ncated no relationship between pronated foot posture and an \nincreased risk of the development of PFP. However, measures \nof foot mobility can discriminate between those with PFP and \nknee-healthy controls.16,33,193\nIIA systematic review found limited evidence from 3 \nstudies for plantar loading (ie, plantar pressure) as \na risk factor for PFP.92 Greater lateral COP dis -\nplacement and lower maximal displacement velocity of me -\ndiolateral COP during midstance of walking were \ndemonstrated in people who developed PFP. During running, \nhigher rates of time to peak force in the lateral heel and peak \nforce in the central metatarsal regions were demonstrated in \npeople who developed PFP.\nIIITan et al276 reported that people aged 40 to 50 years \nwith PFP had less foot mobility than people aged 18 \nto 29 years and aged 30 to 39 years who also had PFP.\n Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy® \n Downloaded from www.jospt.org at on November 12, 2025.

The authors also reported that \nthere is strong evidence that pain coping skills and kinesio -\nphobia are not predictive of PFP or patellofemoral symptoms \nand function. Baseline pain intensity is not predictive of pain \nat follow-up, and baseline activity-related pain is not predic -\ntive of function at follow-up. There is moderate evidence that \nthe triple jump test; muscle length of the quadriceps, ham -\nstrings, or soleus; and activities of daily living (ADLs) are not \npredictive of pain or function. Bilateral symptoms and the \nstep test are not predictive of pain. There was limited evi -\ndence that BMI, anxiety, being an athlete, and movement \nquality were not predictive of pain or function. There was \nalso limited evidence that gastrocnemius muscle length, de -\npression, working status, and the single-leg jump test did not \npredict pain. In addition, there is limited evidence that fear \navoidance at work, muscle recruitment, work type, and pre -\nferred treatment were not predictive of function.\nIIn a follow-up study of 2 RCTs at 5 to 8 years, 57% \nof participants reported unfavorable outcomes, but \nthere was a minimal presence of knee OA.57,173 Simi -\nlar to previous studies, those with a longer duration of symp -\ntoms and poorer function were more likely to have worse \noutcomes at long-term follow-up.174\nIAn RCT was conducted to investigate the effects of \nprefabricated foot orthoses, flat inserts, and physi -\ncal therapy on individuals with PFP.57 Individuals \ntreated with physical therapy, prefabricated foot orthoses, or \na combination of both demonstrated improvement in at least \n85% of cases at 6 weeks and at least 80% of cases at 52 weeks. \nLonger duration of symptoms and poorer function, as mea -\nsured by the AKPS, were most often associated with poor \noutcomes.57\nIIA systematic review was performed by Matthews et \nal189 to determine which factors could predict out -\ncomes in patients with PFP. Longer duration of \nknee pain (greater than 4 months), older age, higher baseline \npain severity, and lower patient-reported function on the \nAKPS were predictive of unsuccessful outcomes for pain and \nfunction.\nIICollins et al59 described the proportions of individu -\nals with poor outcomes at 3 and 12 months after \nrandomization in 2 different clinical trials with a \ntotal of 310 patients. More than half (55%) of individuals re -\nported an unfavorable outcome at 3 months, and 40% re -\nported an unfavorable outcome at 12 months. Individuals \nwith a duration of pain greater than 2 months from random -\nization, worse resting or activity-related pain, and poorer Summary\nPhysically active women were more likely to develop PFP \ncompared to physically active men. Participation by women \nin a single sport as opposed to participation by women in \nmultiple sports was associated with a higher incidence of \nPFP. Isometric knee extensor weakness was predictive of the \ndevelopment of PFP. Women with PFP may have lower knee \nextensor, hip extensor, hip abductor, and hip external rotator \nstrength than women without PFP.\nIn studies of men and women, weakness in isometric muscle \nstrength of the hip and knee and decreased flexibility of the \nquadriceps, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius muscles may be \npresent in people with PFP.\nInconclusive and conflicting evidence exists on the relation -\nship between altered foot mechanics and the development \nor presence of PFP.\nPsychological Factors\nIIA systematic review by Maclachlan et al186 exam -\nined the association of psychological factors in pa -\ntients with PFP. They reviewed 25 studies that \nincluded 1357 participants with PFP (66% female) and 349 \nhealthy controls (48% female), with subgroupings based on \n4 psychological constructs: mental health, cognitive factors, \nbehavioral factors, and other psychological factors. They re -\nported that mental health (anxiety, depression), cognitive \nfactors (pain catastrophizing), and behavioral factors (fear of \nmovement) may be elevated in participants with PFP, and are \nlikely associated with higher pain and lower function. A sub -\nsequent cross-sectional study by the same authors187 com -\npared psychological profiles between 100 participants with \nPFP and 50 controls who were matched for age, sex, and ac -\ntivity levels. This study also included a preplanned subgroup \nanalysis according to the severity of PFP (based on the Knee \ninjury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS]). No dif -\nferences were seen between the PFP and pain-free groups for \nanxiety, depression, catastrophizing, and kinesiophobia. \nHowever, those with more severe PFP demonstrated higher \nlevels of depression and catastrophizing compared to the \ncontrols, and higher levels of kinesiophobia, depression, and \ncatastrophizing compared to the less severe PFP subgroup.\nPrognostic Factors\nIPanken et al219 performed a systematic review to \ndetermine which clinical factors were able to pre -\ndict pain, function, or recovery in patients with \nPFP. They reported limited evidence for several factors as \npredictors of pain: frequency of pain, pain catastrophizing, \nfear avoidance, AKPS scores, quadriceps cross-sectional area, \nand muscle recruitment.

Many of these classification systems are based on \nproposed pathoanatomical diagnoses, which rely on diagnos -\ntic imaging or surgical findings.108,144,148,195,256,306,315 These clas -\nsification systems are of limited utility for physical therapists \nbecause they do not include clear diagnostic criteria for each \nsubcategory, or they rely on imaging or surgical findings that \nmay not always be available to the physical therapist at the \ninitial encounter.function, as measured by the AKPS, were more likely to have \nan unfavorable recovery.59\nSummary\nIndividuals with a longer duration of symptoms, higher base -\nline pain severity, and poorer function were more likely to \nhave negative outcomes or unfavorable recovery.\nDIAGNOSIS\nISystematic reviews of diagnostic tests for PFP \ndemonstrate that the majority of clinical tests have \npoor diagnostic accuracy.64,215 Clusters of diagnos -\ntic tests were found to be no more accurate than individual \ntests.215 A high-quality systematic review reported that the \nmost accurate diagnostic tests were reproduction of retro -\npatellar pain during squatting (positive likelihood ratio \n[+LR] = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.3, 2.3; negative likelihood ratio [–\nLR] = 0.2; 95% CI: 0.1, 0.4) and hypomobility with the pa -\ntellar tilt test (+LR = 5.4; 95% CI: 1.4, 20.8; –LR = 0.6; 95% \nCI: 0.5, 0.8).215\nIA systematic review of reviews concluded that func -\ntional tasks that cause AKP, such as squatting, stair \nclimbing, and sitting with flexed knees, are cur -\nrently the best diagnostic tests for PFP.222 Accordingly, in the \nrecent study by Collins et al,61 a large majority of individuals \nwith PFP reported at least some difficulty with squatting \n(93.7%), stair negotiation (91.2%), and running (90.8%).\nIIA systematic review on the accuracy of diagnostic \ntests for PFP reported that diagnosis is challenging \nin part due to the lack of a clear gold standard as a \nreference test.64 Studies of diagnostic test accuracy rely on a \nphysician’s diagnosis, the presence of AKP believed to be re -\nlated to the PFJ, and/or provocation of retropatellar/peri -\npatellar pain with activity as reference standards.64\nIIA systematic review examining diagnostic test ac -\ncuracy for PFP reported that this condition should \nbe considered a diagnosis of exclusion; other condi -\ntions that may cause AKP must be ruled out prior to ruling \nin PFP.64,71,311\nEvidence Synthesis and Clinical Rationale\nDiagnosis of PFP is challenging due to differing reference \nstandards used to determine diagnostic test accuracy.64 Re-\ngardless of reference standard, diagnostic tests for PFP have \npoor accuracy.64,215,222 Clusters of diagnostic tests that have \nbeen examined to date have not improved diagnostic accu -\nracy.215 The best diagnostic tests at this time are those that \nprovoke AKP during functional activities when the PFJ is \nloaded in a flexed-knee position.222 Accordingly, reproduc -\n Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy® \n Downloaded from www.jospt.org at on November 12, 2025.

They found a moderate positive cor -\nrelation between tracer uptake in PFJ bone and pain intensity \n(R2 = 0.55, P = .0005), suggesting an association between bone \nremodeling and PFP.93 Individuals at risk of developing PFP \ndue to overuse may include athletes55,128,277,278 and the military \npopulation when undergoing basic training.155,277\nLoad Magnitude\nLoad magnitude refers to the amount of PFJ loading result -\ning from physical activity. Briani et al37 compared reported \nknee pain in women with and without PFP who participat -\ned in moderate or intense physical activity. Women in the \nintense physical activity PFP group reported significantly \nhigher self-reported knee pain during the previous month \nand before a PFJ loading protocol used in this study.37 A re -\ngression analysis revealed that 32% of reported pain intensity \nwas predicted by intense physical activity levels. Moderate \nphysical activity level was not a significant predictor of pain.\nOne population that experiences rapid increases in the over -\nall magnitude of PFJ loading is military recruits during basic \ntraining. Thijs et al281 conducted a prospective study of male \nand female officer cadets entering a military academy and ini -\ntiated a 6-week intensive physical training program. Eighty-\nfour of the 105 cadets had no history of previous knee injury or \npain (65 males). Thirty-six of these 84 (43%) cadets (25 males) \ndeveloped PFP during training. The authors concluded that \nPFP in this population resulted from repetitive loads placed \non the PFJ tissues with minimal recovery time.281\nOveruse as a cause of PFP may be related to greater running \nmagnitude and runner experience (eg, recreational runners \nand higher-caliber runners). A retrospective analysis of 2002 \npatients with running injuries showed that the most com -\nmon running-related injury for both sexes was PFP.277 Mul -\ntivariate analysis revealed that being either a higher-caliber IIISelfe et al261 conducted a cross-sectional observa -\ntional study examining a classification system con -\nsisting of 6 proposed subcategories for PFP, the \ntargeted interventions for patellofemoral pain syndrome \n(TIPPS). These 6 subcategories were based on expert consen -\nsus and clinically feasible assessment tests.258 Because the \nsubcategories were found to not be mutually exclusive,261 the \noriginal 6 subcategories were revised and collapsed into 3 \nsubcategories: weak and tight, weak and pronated foot, and \nstrong.261 The TIPPS classification system has yet to be ap -\nplied to patients to determine its efficacy in guiding treat -\nment and improving outcomes.\nIVA PFP classification system that utilizes clinical \ntests was proposed by Selhorst et al262 in a case-se -\nries pilot feasibility study for targeted interven -\ntions. The authors used results from the Fear-Avoidance \nBeliefs Questionnaire and clinical tests of impairment and \nneuromuscular deficits to classify patients. This classification \npilot study was conducted in adolescents with a mean ± SD \nage of 14.10 ± 1.38 years,262 potentially resulting in minimal \napplicability to adults with PFP.\nEvidence Synthesis and Clinical Rationale\nPatellofemoral pain is a heterogeneous condition; persons \nwith PFP do not all have the same impairments, and not all \npersons with PFP respond to the same interventions.18,311 At \nthis time, there is no valid and reliable classification system \nfor PFP that does not require imaging or surgical findings. \nA classification system based on symptoms and physical \nexamination findings would be useful to guide the physical \ntherapist’s plan of care.258,261,262 Such a classification system \nwould be useful to select interventions for persons with PFP. \nIt would also be useful for researchers to examine factors \nassociated with subcategories of PFP and to determine the \noptimal interventions for each subcategory.\nGaps in Knowledge\nNo PFP classification system exists that is based on symp -\ntoms and physical examination findings and has been shown \nto be valid and reliable.\nRecommendation\nFGiven the absence of a previously established valid \nclassification system for PFP, the CPG group pro -\nposes a classification consisting of 4 subcategories \nassociated with the ICF. This proposed classification system \nis based on published evidence; the subcategories are named \naccording to predominant impairments previously docu -\nmented in persons with PFP. Clinicians may consider using \nthe proposed impairment/function-based PFP classification \nsystem to guide patient/client management.\n Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy® \n Downloaded from www.jospt.org at on November 12, 2025.

Support for the “muscle performance deficits” subcategory \nis based on the following evidence.\nHip Strength Deficits\nIIIFemales with PFP have hip weakness, particularly \nwith isometric strength testing.241,245,286 Originally \nthought to be a risk factor for PFP onset, hip weak -\nness, especially of the hip abductors, extensors, and external \nrotators, has been shown to result from PFP.133,245\nHip/Thigh Strength Responders\nThe reason for the resulting hip weakness remains unclear; \nhowever, evidence supports the importance of resistance ex -\nercises targeting the hip muscles as part of the intervention \nfor individuals with PFP.168,228 While an important treatment \nstrategy, not all individuals with PFP may respond favorably. \nFerber et al105 compared outcomes for 199 individuals with \nPFP who completed either a 6-week hip/core- or knee-based \nexercise program. They found that 67% of participants re -\nsponded favorably to treatment, regardless of group assign -\nment. In a secondary analysis, the authors determined that \nonly males and females who exhibited an increase in hip and \nthigh strength following treatment responded positively to \nthe resistance exercise intervention.31 Beginning strength \nvalues, expressed as a percentage of body mass, for males \nwho responded favorably were, on average, 37%, 13%, 28%, \nand 44% of body mass for the hip abductors, hip external \nrotators, hip extensors, and quadriceps, respectively. Values \nfor female responders were, on average, 30%, 17%, 30%, and \n37% of body mass for the hip abductors, hip external rotators, \nhip extensors, and quadriceps, respectively.\nGap in Knowledge\nWhile we have provided average values to identify weakness, \nadditional investigations are needed to further quantify \nstrength values using identical methods.\nSummary\nA subcategory of individuals with PFP may respond favorably \nto hip and knee resistance exercises. Classification into the \nmuscle performance deficits subcategory is made with a fair \nlevel of certainty when the patient presents with lower extrem -\nity muscle performance deficits in the hip and quadriceps.\n3. Support for the “movement coordination deficits” subcat -\negory is based on the following evidence.\nIIIPowers237 has theorized that increased hip adduc -\ntion, hip internal rotation, and knee abduction (ie, \nknee valgus) during dynamic activities can increase runner, defined as competing at provincial/state, national, or \ninternational levels (ie, highly competitive running level), or \na recreational runner who ran less than 5 hours per week was \na protective factor for PFP onset in females.277 This finding \nsuggested that the PFJ structures in the most experienced \nrunners most likely had adapted to, and thus were capable \nof tolerating, the imposed loads. Alternatively, runners with \nmuch less experience most likely did not apply the magnitude \nof loading necessary to adversely affect the PFJ.\nAn injury prevention program had no effect on PFP or oth -\ner lower extremity overuse injuries in military recruits.38 \nBrushøj et al38 developed a prevention program to address \ncommon impairments (eg, gluteal and quadriceps muscle \nweakness, quadriceps tightness, and increased knee valgus \nduring squatting and lunging tasks) for military recruits \nprior to beginning a 3-month basic training program. At the \nend of the basic training program, no differences existed in \noveruse injury rates between those who participated in the \nprevention program and controls.38 This finding suggests that \nincreased magnitude of PFJ loading during physical activity, \nwith insufficient tissue recovery time, may be the strongest \netiologic factor for PFP in the military population.\nLoad Frequency\nLoad frequency refers to the amount of repetition of an activi -\nty. Recreational runners who increase not only the magnitude \nof loading but also the frequency of loading, with inadequate \ntissue recovery time, represent a cohort at high risk for de -\nveloping PFP. Thijs et al279 examined the foot posture (higher \nor lower arch) and motion (pronation and supination) of 102 \n(89 females) novice recreational runners enrolled in a 10-\nweek start-to-run program. They prospectively followed the \nrunners and reported that 17 participants developed PFP. \nAnalyses showed that neither foot posture nor motion pre -\ndicted PFP onset.279 In a subsequent prospective study, Thijs \net al280 followed 77 novice female recreational runners (with \nno history of prior knee injury or pain) enrolled in a 10-week \nstart-to-run program to determine the effect of peak isomet -\nric hip muscle force on PFP onset. Sixteen runners developed \nPFP; however, logistic regression did not identify isometric \nhip force as a predictive factor for onset of PFP.280 Together, \nresults from these studies showed that impairments com -\nmonly associated with PFP were not predictive of PFP on -\nset. These findings suggested that beginning a new repetitive \nactivity involving PFJ loading could have caused PFP onset.\nSummary\nA subcategory of individuals with PFP may have pain primar -\nily due to overuse/overload.

Support for the “mobility impairments” subcategory is \nbased on the following evidence.\nHypermobility-Related Influences\nIIIAlthough patellar instability is outside the scope \nof this CPG, increased foot mobility deserves at -\ntention. Selfe et al261 classified individuals with \nPFP and a greater than 6-point Foot Posture Index (FPI) \nscore as having a pronated foot. Mills et al196 found benefi -\ncial effects with orthosis use for individuals with PFP and a \ngreater than 11-mm difference between non–weight-bearing \nand weight-bearing midfoot width. Moreover, the use of \nfoot orthoses has been recommended as an adjunctive treat -\nment for PFP.18\nHypomobility-Related Influences\nLack of flexibility of structures around the knee has been \nmore extensively examined due to their direct or indirect \npotential for increasing the compressive forces at the PFJ. \nCommonly assessed structures have included the ham -\nstrings, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, soleus, lateral reti -\nnaculum (using the patellar tilt test), and iliotibial band. \nPiva at al232 found several significant differences when \ncomparing flexibility between those with and without PFP. \nIn individuals with PFP, hamstring (measured by passive \nhip flexion during a straight leg raise performed in supine), \ngastrocnemius (measured by ankle dorsiflexion performed \nin prone with the knee extended), and soleus (measured \nby ankle dorsiflexion performed in prone with the knee \nflexed) lengths, when measured by goniometry, were less \nthan 79.1°, 7.4°, and 14.8°, respectively. The authors also \nreported values of less than 11° for iliotibial band (measured \nin the Ober position with the knee flexed to 90°) and 134.0° \nfor quadriceps (measured with prone knee flexion) lengths \nwhen measured using an inclinometer. A positive patellar \ntilt test assessed via palpation can suggest lateral retinacu -\nlum tightness in the PFP population.215\nGaps in Knowledge\nHip internal and external rotation ROM has received some \nattention. Specifically, limited hip external rotation ROM \ncould place the femur in a more internally rotated position, \nleading to an increased dynamic Q angle and lateral PFJ \nloading.130,236 Further work is needed to identify threshold \nvalues for hip ROM potentially contributing to PFP. Future \nstudies also are needed to better understand responses to \ntreatment specifically directed toward these structures.the dynamic Q angle. Knee abduction and external rotation \nalso increase the Q angle by moving the tibial tubercle lateral \nrelative to the patella. Together, these altered movements can \nimpart increased stress to the lateral PFJ.177,253\nClinicians commonly observe hip and knee movement dur -\ning an SLS to identify individuals with PFP and movement \ncoordination deficits. Findings from independent investiga -\ntions support that females with PFP perform the SLS with an \nincreased FPPA134 and greater medial knee displacement125,307 \nthan controls. Medial knee displacement during the SLS also \nhas been associated with increased hip adduction and knee \nexternal rotation during running and jumping tasks.307 It is \nnoteworthy that these investigators did not assess hip or knee \nstrength,134,307 precluding the ability to discern the effect, if \nany, of hip and knee strength on the FPPA.\nAlmeida et al5 compared hip strength and the FPPA during \nthe SLS in individuals with and without PFP. Those with PFP \ndemonstrated less hip strength and higher FPPA than con -\ntrols. However, a significant correlation between hip strength \nand FPPA only existed for controls, and these correlations, \nwhile significant, were not strong for controls (hip abduc -\ntor torque and peak FPPA: P<.05, R2 = 0.096). This finding \nsuggested that factors other than strength likely affected SLS \nperformance in those with PFP.242\nDecreased neuromuscular control may contribute to an in -\ncreased FPPA during dynamic tasks. While we cannot con -\nclusively make this determination, emerging data support \nthe importance of movement retraining. Graci and Salsich120 \nexamined trunk, hip, and knee kinematics during the SLS \nin females with PFP under 2 conditions (with and without \ninstruction for maintaining good pelvic and hip position) in \na single session. With instruction, participants performed \nthe SLS with a significant increase in contralateral pelvic \nelevation and decreases in hip adduction and internal rota -\ntion. Moreover, a significant association existed between de -\ncreased pain and less hip internal rotation ( r = 0.46).\nGaps in Knowledge\nAdditional studies are needed to identify the best methods \nand threshold values for identifying movement coordination \ndeficits.131 Future works also are needed to better understand \nthe effect that movement retraining may specifically have on \nthese measures.\nSummary\nA subcategory of individuals with PFP may respond fa -\nvorably to gait retraining and movement re-education \ninterventions, leading to improvements in lower extrem -\nity kinematics and pain and suggesting the importance of \nassessing dynamic knee valgus during movement.35,100,206,252 \n Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy® \n Downloaded from www.jospt.org at on November 12, 2025.

Both of these decision \nrules have high sensitivity for acute knee fracture, and their \nuse has been shown to avoid unnecessary radiography.163 The \nOttawa knee rule is reported to be more sensitive than the \nPittsburgh knee rule, but it is limited to persons aged 18 years \nand older.163 The Pittsburgh knee rule may be used with per -\nsons of all ages.163\nHip and thigh pathology has been reported to refer pain to \nthe knee.179 Persons who participate in high levels of physical \nactivity (eg, military personnel undergoing physical training) \nmay develop femoral fractures that masquerade as PFP.45,304 \nChildren and adolescents with knee pain may have referred \npain from a slipped capital femoral epiphysis or other hip \npathology.1,316,317 In children with knee pain, a limp is a sign \nof possible hip pathology.1,316\nMusculoskeletal Differential Diagnosis\nFollowing exclusion of medical conditions that require re -\nferral of the patient to a physician, the clinician must rule \nout other musculoskeletal conditions that may cause AKP. \nThese conditions are appropriate for physical therapy but \nmay require a plan of care that is different from that for the \ntreatment of PFP. The differential diagnosis should consider \nconditions that are distant but may refer pain to the knee, \nfor example, lumbar radiculopathy, peripheral nerve entrap -\nment, or hip OA.24,40\nThe lumbar spine may refer pain to the anterior thigh and \nknee.24,40 Clinicians should perform a lower-quarter screen as \npart of the examination of a patient with suspected PFP, in -\ncluding examination of the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joint \nregions. Clinicians should refer to the low back pain CPG \npublished by the Academy of Orthopaedic Physical Therapy, \nAPTA, Inc for guidance on screening for the presence of re -\nferred pain from the low back.83Summary\nA subcategory of individuals with PFP may have impair -\nments related to either hypermobile or hypomobile struc -\ntures. The diagnosis of PFP with mobility impairments is \nmade with a fair level of certainty when the patient pre  sents \nwith higher than normal foot mobility and/or flexibility def -\nicits of 1 or more of the following structures: hamstrings, \nquadriceps, gastrocnemius, soleus, lateral retinaculum, or \niliotibial band.\nClassification Summary\nClinicians should consider serious pathological conditions \nother than/separate from PFP when the patient’s reported \nactivity limitations or impairments of body function and \nstructure are not consistent with those presented in the \nDiagnosis and Classification sections of this guideline, or \nwhen the patient’s symptoms are not resolving with inter -\nventions aimed at normalization of the patient’s impair -\nments of body function. Clinicians should consider whether \nthe patient corresponds to 1 or more of the following cat -\negories: (1) overuse/overload without other impairment, \n(2) muscle performance deficits, (3) movement coordina -\ntion deficits, and/or (4) mobility impairments. In addition, \nclinicians should identify the level of tissue irritability and \nshould screen for the presence of psychological factors that \nmay impact the patient’s response to physical therapy and/\nor require referral to another health care practitioner.\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\nClinicians should consider diagnostic classifications associ -\nated with serious medical conditions, other musculoskeletal \nconditions, or psychosocial factors when the patient’s re -\nported activity limitations or impairments of body function \nand structure are not consistent with those presented in \nthe Diagnosis and Classification sections of this guideline, \nor when the patient’s symptoms are not resolving with in -\nterventions aimed at normalization of the patient’s impair -\nments of body function.\nMedical Differential Diagnosis\nThe following medical conditions, although not intended to \nbe a comprehensive list, should be in the clinician’s differen -\ntial diagnosis for knee pain and require referral to another \nhealth care practitioner43:\n• Tumors\n• Dislocation\n• Septic arthritis\n• Arthrofibrosis\n• Deep vein thrombosis\n• Neurovascular compromise\n• Fracture (local and/or at the hip)\n• Slipped capital femoral epiphysis in children or adolescents\n Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy® \n Downloaded from www.jospt.org at on November 12, 2025.

Psychologi -\ncal stress negatively influences recovery. Fear of reinjury/\npain/movement is a frequently cited reason that athletes do \nnot return to sport or reduce their level of physical activity \nin other knee disorders.9,10 A systematic review reported that \ncatastrophization and fear avoidance had strong and con -\nsistent associations with pain and function in persons with \nPFP.186 Chronic pain can be accompanied by central sensitiza -\ntion, which encompasses factors like hyperalgesia (reduced \npressure pain threshold) to regions both at and remote to the \n“involved” structure. Noehren et al213 found that females with \nPFP reported lower pressure pain thresholds (determined via \npressure algometry) in multiple sites at the knee as well as \nthe elbow.Hip OA has been reported to present with a primary com -\nplaint of knee pain.171,233 Clinicians should refer to the hip \npain and mobility deficits—hip OA CPG published by the \nAcademy of Orthopaedic Physical Therapy, APTA, Inc for \nguidance on the examination procedures and symptoms to \ndetermine the presence of hip OA.51,52\nThe differential diagnosis should also consider conditions lo -\ncal to the knee, for example, ligamentous (cruciate and collat -\neral) injuries, meniscus injuries, articular cartilage injuries, \nOA, distal iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS), quadriceps and \npatellar tendinopathies, plica syndrome, patellar (Sinding-\nLarsen-Johansson lesion) and tibial (Osgood-Schlatter le -\nsion) apophysitis, and patellar subluxation or dislocation \n(instability).\nStructures that are part of the tibiofemoral articulation, such \nas ligament, meniscus, and articular cartilage injuries, may \nbe a source of AKP.227 Clinicians should refer to the CPGs \npublished by the Academy of Orthopaedic Physical Therapy, \nAPTA, Inc for guidance on the examination procedures for \ndetermining the presence of ligamentous, meniscal, and ar -\nticular cartilage conditions/injuries.181-184 Persons with ITBS \nare typically runners, complain of onset of lateral knee pain \nfollowing running for 1.2 km or longer, and have pain pro -\nvoked by palpation of the lateral femoral epicondyle with the \nknee at 30° of flexion (Noble compression test).13\nThe patellofemoral articulation may have musculoskeletal \nconditions other than PFP that cause knee pain.161 The fol -\nlowing differential diagnosis has been suggested for knee \npain based on anatomical site43:\n• Anterior knee pain\n- PFP\n- Patellar tendinopathy (jumper’s knee)\n- Patellar subluxation or dislocation (instability)\n- Tibial apophysitis (Osgood-Schlatter lesion)\n- Patellar apophysitis (Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease)\nClinicians should use information from the patient’s age, \nhistory, provocative activities, and physical examination test \nresults to screen for the presence of other possible causes of \nAKP.43,293 Pain from patellar tendinopathy is typically local -\nized to the inferior pole of the patella or near the tibial tu -\nbercle.188 Patellar tendinopathy may be differentiated from \nPFP by pain located over the patellar tendon, tenderness to \npalpation of the patellar tendon, and symptom response. Pain \nfrom patellar tendinopathy is aggravated by activities that \nrequire higher rates of knee extensor loading, such as jump -\ning (eg, basketball, volleyball) or high-speed sprinting (eg, \nfootball/soccer).188 If patellar instability or a history of patel -\nlar dislocation is suspected from subjective interview, then \nreported apprehension with passively applied lateral patellar \n Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy® \n Downloaded from www.jospt.org at on November 12, 2025.

These PROMs have varying levels of evidence to \nsupport their use for individuals with impairments of body \nfunction and structure, activity limitations, and participation \nrestrictions associated with PFP.\nSystematic Reviews\nIPapadopoulos et al222 performed a high-quality sys -\ntematic review of reviews for several factors related \nto PFP, including outcome measurements. The au -\nthors identified 2 systematic reviews of outcome measures, \nby Howe et al146 and Esculier et al,101 which they evaluated \nusing the A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews \n(AMSTAR) scoring tool. Results of these 2 reviews are pre -\nsented individually below.\nIEsculier et al101 performed a high-quality systematic \nreview of 24 articles on the psychometric properties \nof 5 PROMs. Only PROMs that had at least 5 stud -\nies evaluating their psychometric properties were included: \nthe Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living Scale \n(KOS-ADLS), AKPS (originally known as the Kujala scale), \nInternational Knee Documentation Committee 2000 Subjec -\ntive Knee Evaluation Form (IKDC), Lysholm scale, and FIQ. \nSeveral aspects of validity were assessed: content validity, \nconstruct validity, discriminant (known-groups) validity, \nstructural (factorial) validity, and floor/ceiling effects. The \nKOS-ADLS and Lysholm scale were found to have satisfac -\ntory content validity. The FIQ and AKPS were easy to com -\nplete and were poor and good, respectively, at depicting \nsymptoms. Construct validity for several PFP PROMs was \nexamined by determining correlations between scales: KOS-\nADLS to Lysholm scale, IKDC to Lysholm scale, and AKPS \nto FIQ. These PROMs demonstrated moderate to high cor -\nrelations ( r>0.5) in samples including patients with PFP. The \nKOS-ADLS, AKPS, and Lysholm scale could discriminate \nbetween different patient populations of knee conditions and \ndisability levels. All measures demonstrated adequate floor/\nceiling effects (less than 15% of participants achieved the low -\nest or highest scores). The KOS-ADLS, IKDC, AKPS, and \nLysholm scale demonstrated high test-retest reliability, with \nintraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) ranging from 0.81 to \n0.99 and weighted average ICCs from 0.92 to 0.96. The ICCs for the FIQ ranged from 0.48 to 0.96 (weighted average ICC \n= 0.61). The minimal detectable change at the 95% confi -\ndence level (MDC95) was 8.3 for the KOS-ADLS, 8.5 for the \nIKDC, 9.0 for the AKPS, 3.1 for the FIQ, and 30 for the \nLysholm scale. All questionnaires, except the Lysholm scale, \ndemonstrated good internal consistency, with Cronbach al -\npha values greater than .81 (Lysholm scale: α = .66). All ques -\ntionnaires were found to be moderately to highly responsive \n(moderate to high effect size or standardized response mean) \nin patients with PFP.\nIIA systematic review by Green et al121 reported on 7 \narticles that evaluated the measurement properties \nof 12 PROMs. Several instruments had moderate \nlevels of evidence for structural validity, a component of con -\nstruct validity: the Flandry Questionnaire ( r = 0.65-0.66 with \nthe FIQ and the Eng and Pierrynowski Questionnaire [EPQ]), \nthe FIQ ( r = –0.66 with the Flandry Questionnaire and EPQ), \nthe EPQ ( r = 0.66 with the Flandry Questionnaire), the AKPS \n(r = 0.58 with the FIQ), and the VAS for “usual” pain and the \nVAS for “worst” pain were moderately correlated with each \nother ( r = 0.63). Limited evidence supported test-retest reli -\nability and cross-cultural and hypothesis testing components \nof validity for the Persian version of the AKPS.\nIIIHowe et al146 performed a low-quality systematic \nreview examining the clinimetric properties of \nPROMs used with patients treated for various mus -\nculoskeletal knee conditions, including ligamentous injuries, \nmeniscal lesions, OA, and PFP. The outcome measures ap -\npraised by Howe et al146 also included clinician-administered \ninstruments. In addition to the low quality of the systematic \nreview, the authors did not critically appraise the articles in -\ncluded in their review. Using expert consensus, Howe et al146 \nconcluded that the AKPS demonstrated sufficient content \nvalidity, test-retest reliability, and responsiveness to change \nfor persons with PFP according to the Outcome Measures in \nRheumatology (OMERACT) filter. They also reported that \nthe Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) demonstrated \nsufficient construct validity and test-retest reliability for PFP \naccording to the OMERACT filter.\nAnterior Knee Pain Scale\nThe AKPS, originally known as the Kujala scale, is a 13-item \nquestionnaire for knee function in persons of all ages with \nAKP, scored out of 100, with higher scores indicating less \ndisability.\n Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy® \n Downloaded from www.jospt.org at on November 12, 2025.

Participants with GROC \nratings of +3 or higher (scale of –7 to +7, with –7 as the worst \nstatus and +7 as the best status) were considered to have im -\nproved. Concurrent validity using Spearman’s rho was 0.69. \nTest-retest reliability was evaluated in 2 studies70,302 and was \nfound to be excellent (ICC = 0.817 and 0.953, respectively). \nResponsiveness was reported in several studies. Crossley et \nal70 reported that the AKPS median change score could dis -\ncriminate between those who improved and those who were \nworse or stayed the same. Watson et al302 reported that the \nAKPS change score had a fair association ( r = 0.42) with the \ncriterion score (average of the therapist’s and patient’s GROC \nscore). The AKPS demonstrated fair discriminatory ability \nbetween those with clinically meaningful reduction of patel -\nlofemoral symptoms and those who did not have a reduction \n(area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] \ncurve [AUC] = 0.69). Crossley et al70 reported that the treat -\nment effect size of the AKPS was 1.15. The MDC for the AKPS \nwas 13 points.302 The minimal clinically important difference \n(MCID) for the AKPS is 8 to 10 points.70\nIMyer et al202 developed a 6-item short form of the \nAKPS in 499 girl and adolescent female athletes. \nThe internal consistency of the 13-item form had a \nCronbach alpha of .92 and a standard error of measurement \n(SEM) across all items of 0.003. Rasch difficulty (endors -\nability) estimates of the 6-item short form ranged from –3.57 \nto 1.27. The internal consistency of the 6-item form had a \nCronbach alpha of .88 and an SEM across all items of 0.004. \nCriterion validity of the 6-item form against the 13-item form \nwas r = 0.96, with a point-biserial calculation of each form \nagainst the PFP diagnosis of r = 0.72. The AKPS demon -\nstrated excellent predictive ability between the 13-item long \nform and 6-item short form against the PFP diagnosis (AUC \n= 0.95 for the long form and AUC = 0.93 for the short form). \nA score of 4 on the short form and a score of 10 on the long \nform could correctly confirm a physician’s diagnosis of PFP \nwith a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 91%.\nIIIttenbach et al149 evaluated the reliability and valid -\nity of the AKPS in 414 girl, adolescent female, and \nwoman athletes (11.0-18.1 years of age). Criterion \nvalidity of the AKPS was evaluated against the physician’s \ndiagnosis of knee pain. The median classification rates were \nhigh in both healthy athletes (86%) and in athletes with PFP \n(99%). The AKPS demonstrated good internal consistency \nfor both the 13-item long form (Cronbach α = .91) and 6-item \nshort form (Cronbach α = .84). The equivalence of the short \nform with the long form was high ( r = 0.98). The SEM for the long form was 3.0 points and for the short form was 1.2 \npoints.\nAKPS Cross-cultural T ranslations\nThe AKPS has been translated and cross-culturally adapted \ninto 10 languages, with psychometric evidence to support the \nuse of the translations. These include Brazilian Portuguese,78 \nFrench,39 Persian,209 Turkish,167 Spanish,117 Greek,220 Arabic,6 \nDutch,284 Chinese,49 and Thai.8 The MDC of the Dutch AKPS \nis reported to be 11 points.284\nKOS-ADLS and Knee Outcome Survey-Sports Activity Scale\nThe KOS-ADLS is a 14-item questionnaire for knee symp -\ntoms and function during ADLs due to a variety of knee \ndisorders, including PFP. It is scored out of 70 points, then \nconverted to 100 points to yield percentages, with higher \nscores indicating less disability. The Knee Outcome Survey-\nSports Activity Scale (KOS-SAS) is an 11-item questionnaire \nfor knee symptoms and function during sports activities due \nto a variety of knee disorders. It has a total score of 55 points, \nconverted to 100 points to yield percentages, with higher \nscores indicating less disability.\nIPiva et al231 assessed the responsiveness of the KOS-\nADLS in 60 individuals with PFP before and after \nan intervention program by comparing KOS-ADLS \nscores to GROC scores. The KOS-ADLS had a moderate stan -\ndardized effect size (0.63) and demonstrated excellent dis -\ncrimination between those whose GROC scores worsened \nand those whose scores did not (AUC = 0.83). The MCID for \nthe KOS-ADLS was estimated from a ROC curve and was \nfound to be a 5-point change in raw score or 7.1 percentage \npoints on the KOS-ADLS.\nIIIBradbury et al36 reported on the association be -\ntween KOS-ADLS and KOS-SAS scores with the \nGlobal Rating Scale (GRS) of perceived knee func -\ntion. In a group of 15 patients with PFP, the GRS was strongly \nassociated with the KOS-ADLS ( r = 0.85) and with the KOS-\nSAS ( r = 0.88).\nIVSiqueira et al265 evaluated the KOS-ADLS and \nIKDC in 31 patients with PFP. The KOS-ADLS and \nIKDC were moderately correlated with each other \n(r = 0.46). Test-retest reliability of the KOS-ADLS was excel -\nlent (Spearman ρ = 0.99). The KOS-ADLS was deemed more \nreliable than the IKDC.\nKOS-ADLS Cross-cultural T ranslations\nThe KOS-ADLS has been translated and cross-culturally \nadapted into Turkish, with psychometric evidence to sup -\nport its use.103 The MDC of the Turkish KOS-ADLS was 2.59 \npoints out of a total score of 70 points.\n Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy® \n Downloaded from www.jospt.org at on November 12, 2025.

The MDC for \nthe Greek PSS was 1.87 points.221 The MDC for the Chinese \nPSS was 6.34 points.48\nPain VAS and EPQ\nIThe 10-cm VAS has been evaluated for reliability, \nvalidity, and responsiveness for ratings of “usual” \npain, “worst” pain, and pain during activity (VAS \nfor activity, also known as the EPQ).47,70 Chesworth et al47 \nevaluated the test-retest reliability of the VAS for worst pain \nin 18 patients with PFP and found moderate reliability ( r = \n0.60). Crossley et al70 evaluated the test-retest reliability of \nthe VAS for worst pain and the VAS for usual pain in 17 \npatients with PFP and found moderate reliability for both \nmeasures (ICC = 0.76 and 0.56, respectively). Crossley et \nal70 also evaluated the test-retest reliability for VAS pain \nduring 6 aggravating activities (walking, running, squatting, \nsitting, ascending stairs, and descending stairs), with the \ncombined score being referred to as the VAS for activity or \nEPQ. The VAS for activity’s test-retest reliability was excel -\nlent (ICC = 0.83).70 Concurrent validity, assessed with cor -\nrelation of change (Spearman rho), in each outcome \ninstrument with the GROC was –0.67 for the VAS for usual \npain, –0.68 for the VAS for worst pain, and –0.68 for the \nVAS for activity. Responsiveness was defined as the per -\nceived rating of change. Each outcome measure’s median \nchange score could discriminate between those who im -\nproved and those who were worse or stayed the same. The \ntreatment effect size was 0.95 for the VAS for usual pain, \n1.09 for the VAS for worst pain, and 0.76 for the VAS for \nactivity. The MCID for each measure was 1.5 to 2 cm for the \nVAS for usual pain, 2 cm for the VAS for worst pain, and 8 \nto 13 cm for the VAS for activity.\nNumeric Pain-Rating Scale\nIPiva et al231 assessed the responsiveness of the \n11-point numeric pain-rating scale (NPRS), with 0 \nbeing “no pain” and 10 being the “worst imaginable \npain,” in 60 individuals with PFP before and after an inter -\nvention program. The NPRS had a moderate standardized \neffect size (0.74) and demonstrated excellent discrimination \nbetween those whose scores worsened and those whose \nscores did not (AUC = 0.84). The MCID for the NPRS was \n–1.2 points for a decrease in pain score, according to the ROC \ncurve.The FIQ and Modified FIQ\nThe FIQ is an 8-item questionnaire for knee function due to \na variety of knee disorders, including PFP. It is scored out of \n16 points, with higher scores indicating less disability. The \nmodified FIQ is a 10-item questionnaire for knee pain and \nfunction for a variety of knee disorders, including PFP. The \nmodified FIQ is scored out of 100 points, with higher scores \nindicating greater disability and worse pain.\nIThe psychometric properties of the English version \nof the FIQ have been examined in 2 level I stud -\nies.47,70 The test-retest reliability was fair in both \nstudies: Chesworth et al47 (r = 0.48) and Crossley et al70 (ICC \n= 0.49). Concurrent validity was assessed in comparison with \nthe GROC, and the Spearman rho was 0.65.70 Responsiveness \nwas defined as the perceived rating of change. The FIQ me -\ndian change score could discriminate between those who \nimproved and those who were worse or stayed the same.70 \nThe treatment effect size was 0.49.70 The FIQ had an MCID \nof 2 points or 13% of the total score.70\nIVSelfe et al259,260 investigated the reliability and valid -\nity of the modified FIQ in 77 participants (66.2% \nfemale). The modified FIQ is a 10-item question -\nnaire whose language was modified for a European popula -\ntion and that includes additional questions modified from the \nAKPS. Internal consistency, measured with Cronbach’s alpha, \nwas .83.260 Test-retest reliability was assessed by calculating \nthe mean of 2 modified FIQ scores and then subtracting each \nindividual score from the mean to determine the error for \neach individual score. Using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Z sta-\ntistic, the error scores were found to be normally distributed, \nindicating acceptable test-retest reliability (1.24; P = .09).260\nFIQ Cross-cultural T ranslations\nThe FIQ has been translated and cross-culturally adapted \ninto Brazilian Portuguese78 and Persian,208 with psychometric \nevidence to support their use.\nPatellofemoral Pain Syndrome Severity Scale\nThe Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome Severity Scale (PSS) is \na 10-item VAS questionnaire for knee pain severity during \nvarious activities in persons with AKP, scored out of 100, with \nhigher scores indicating less disability.\nILaprade and Culham175 developed the PSS and \nevaluated its validity and test-retest reliability in 29 \nmilitary participants with PFP (7 females).

Sev -\neral have been translated and cross-culturally adapted from \nEnglish to various languages and cultures. At this time, the \nstrongest evidence for validity, reliability, and responsive -\nness to change exists for the AKPS, KOOS-PF, and VAS for \nactivity (EPQ). The AKPS has several translated and cross-\nculturally adapted versions, with varying levels of evidence \nto support their validity, reliability, and responsiveness to \nchange. The VAS for worst pain and VAS for usual pain have \nmoderate reliability, concurrent validity, and responsiveness \nto change. The NPRS has evidence for responsiveness to \nchange. Several additional PROMs have varying evidence \nto support their use as measures of pain and function in \npersons with PFP.\nRecommendation\nAClinicians should use the AKPS, KOOS-PF, or VAS \nfor activity (EPQ) questionnaires to measure pain \nand function in patients with PFP. In addition, cli -\nnicians should use the VAS for worst pain, the VAS for usual \npain, or the NPRS to measure pain. Clinicians should use one \nof the translations and cross-cultural adaptations with dem -\nonstrated validity, reliability, and responsiveness to change \nfor patients in different countries and for those requiring \nquestionnaires in languages other than English.\nACTIVITY LIMITATIONS\nPhysical Performance Measures\nIThe most accurate diagnostic clinical test for PFP \nis reproduction of pain with squatting.64,215 The \nsquatting maneuver is performed in a manner that \nfeels normal to the individual. The test has a high –LR of 0.10 \nto 0.20 (95% CI: 0.1, 0.4) ( TABLE 2 ), indicating that the prob -\nability of PFP being present when there is a negative test is \nmoderately decreased.63,215,303\nISensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios were \ncalculated for pain with stair climbing and pain \nwith kneeling. These tests demonstrated moderate \nto high sensitivity and –LR ( TABLE 2 ), suggesting that the \nprobability of PFP is moderately decreased when there is a \nnegative test.63,65,205\nICollins et al61 conducted a retrospective review of 4 \nseparate studies of persons with PFP, including 459 \ntotal participants, and found that 54.4% of persons \nwith PFP reported increased knee pain with prolonged sit -\nting. Pain with prolonged sitting was found to have low to \nmoderate diagnostic accuracy in an earlier systematic re -\nview,64 which suggests that its presence may be a diagnostic \nindicator for PFP ( TABLE 2 ).Patellofemoral Pain and Osteoarthritis Subscale of the KOOS\nICrossley et al73 developed and evaluated a new KOOS \nsubscale, the patellofemoral pain and osteoarthritis \nsubscale (KOOS-PF). The KOOS-PF is an 11-item \nquestionnaire for pain, stiffness, and quality of life in persons \nwith PFP and knee OA. It is scored out of 100 points, with \nhigher scores meaning less disability.73 In evaluating the mea -\nsurement properties of the KOOS-PF in 132 patients, the in -\nternal consistency was .86 (Cronbach’s alpha), the test-retest \nreliability was 0.86 (ICC), and the SEM was 6.8. The structural \nvalidity loaded mostly on 1 factor, “knee pain relating to activi -\nties that load the PF joint,” with an eigenvalue of 4.29. The \nKOOS-PF demonstrated moderate to good construct validity \n(convergent validity) with the AKPS ( r = 0.74) and Medical \nOutcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) \nphysical component summary ( r = 0.45). Construct validity \nwas also established by a hypothesized low correlation of the \nKOOS-PF score with the SF-36 mental component summary \n(r = 0.07) (divergent validity). The KOOS-PF demonstrated \ngood discriminant validity; those with higher levels of baseline \npain had lower baseline KOOS-PF scores, and vice versa. The \nKOOS-PF change scores had fair responsiveness compared to \nGROC scores ( r = 0.52). The individual MDC of the KOOS-PF \nwas 16 points. The minimal important change was 14.2 points. \nNo floor or ceiling effects were reported.\nThe IKDC\nThe IKDC is a 10-item questionnaire for knee symptoms, \nfunction, and sports participation, with a maximum score \nof 100 points (least disability). The IKDC is designed for \npersons with orthopaedic conditions of the knee, includ -\ning PFP.\nIVSiqueira et al265 evaluated the IKDC in 31 patients \nwith PFP. Criterion validity of the IKDC was examined \nthrough comparison of scores with the KOS-ADLS \nusing a Spearman correlation test. The IKDC was moderately \ncorrelated with the KOS-ADLS ( ρ= 0.46). Test-retest reliability \nof the IKDC was excellent (Spearman ρ = 0.96).\nLysholm Scale\nThe Lysholm scale is an 8-item questionnaire for knee symp -\ntoms, signs, and disability scored out of 100 points (100 is the \nleast disability). It was originally designed for patients fol -\nlowing knee ligament surgery but has been studied in other \npopulations, including patients with PFP.101 Psychometric \nproperties of the Lysholm scale are reported in the System -\natic Reviews section under Esculier et al.101\nLysholm Scale Cross-cultural Review\nThe Lysholm scale has been translated and cross-culturally \nadapted into Turkish, with psychometric evidence to support \nits use.46\n Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy® \n Downloaded from www.jospt.org at on November 12, 2025.

Nijs et al210 report -\ned high specificity (0.93; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.99) and +LR (2.26; \n95% CI: 1.9, 2.9) for this test ( TABLE 3 ).\nIIIThere is a paucity of reliability and validity data for \na number of tests to assess passive accessory motion \nof the patella relative to the femur (passive gliding \npatella, lateral pull test, patellar inferior pole test), with the \nreported data indicating poor to fair reliability ( κ = 0.31-\n0.59).126,275,300 These patellar mobility tests demonstrate low \ndiagnostic accuracy for PFP ( TABLE 3 ).\nFoot Position T ests\nIIThe navicular drop test is used to assess the amount \nof subtalar pronation.263 Interrater and intrarater \nreliability (ICC = 0.87-0.93 and ICC = 0.78-0.81, \nrespectively) for the navicular drop test in patients with PFP \nis good to excellent ( TABLE 3 ).16,230\nIISelfe et al261 used the FPI to identify patients with \npronated feet. The FPI is a 6-item scale that assesses \nfoot position based on talar head palpation, the cur -\nvature above and below the lateral malleolus, rearfoot inver -\nsion/eversion, and forefoot abduction/adduction. Patients with \nhigher scores have more pronated feet.248,249,261 The reliability \nand validity of this measure are fair to good (ICCs from 0.52 \nto 0.93) ( TABLE 3 ).16,66,249\nIIIMidfoot width measured in a non–weight-bear -\ning and a weight-bearing position has been used \nto measure foot mobility. Like the FPI, the mid -\nfoot width measurement has excellent reliability and valid -\nity (ICC = 0.97-0.99).192 The MDC95 is 0.14 cm for the \nmidfoot difference in weight bearing and 0.31 cm for the \nmidfoot difference in non–weight bearing.192 Mills et al196 \nreported that individuals with PFP who had a 1.1-cm or \ngreater difference on the test had significantly greater im -\nprovements in pain with the use of foot orthoses compared \nto controls.IThe eccentric step-down test demonstrates \nmoderate specificity (0.82; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.93) \nand +LR (2.3; 95% CI: 1.9, 2.9), suggesting that \nthe probability of PFP being present when there is a posi -\ntive test is moderately increased ( TABLE 2 ).215 Reproduc -\ntion of AKP during the test is considered a positive test \nresult.210\nIIAnother test to assess movement quality is the \nFPPA during the SLS. The FPPA, a measure of \nknee valgus, is calculated by drawing a line on a \nphoto from the anterior superior iliac spine to the midpoint \nof the tibiofemoral joint, and another line from the mid -\npoint of the tibiofemoral joint to the midpoint of the ankle \nmortise, and measuring the resulting angle.308 The FPPA \nhas acceptable between-day reliability for healthy men (ICC \n= 0.88; 95% CI: 0.82, 0.93) and women (ICC = 0.72; 95% \nCI: 0.56, 0.82) as a test for increased knee valgus during the \nSLS ( TABLE 2 ).201\nIIHarris-Hayes et al131 performed a cross-sectional \nstudy of 30 athletes to determine the reliability of \nvideo assessments of lower extremity movement pat -\nterns (FPPA) and the construct validity of the measurement. \nObservers classified lower extremity movement patterns as \ndynamic valgus (greater than 10°  in the positive direction), \ndynamic varus (greater than 10°  in the negative direction), or \nno change (less than 10°  in either direction). They reported \nkappa values ranging from 0.80 to 0.90 for intratester reli -\nability and 0.75 to 0.90 for intertester reliability.\nIIIPiva et al230 developed an assessment of the quality \nof movement during a lateral step-down test to as -\nsess lower extremity biomechanics during a dynam -\nic task in individuals with PFP. Intertester reliability varies \nfrom 0.67 to 0.81 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.94),81,230,242 with 80% rater \nagreement ( TABLE 2 ).230\nRecommendation\nBClinicians should administer appropriate clinical or \nfield tests that reproduce pain and assess lower-\nlimb movement coordination, such as squatting, \nstep-downs, and the SLS. These tests can assess a patient’s \nbaseline status relative to pain, function, and disability; glob -\nal knee function; and changes in the patient’s status through -\nout the course of treatment.\nPHYSICAL IMPAIRMENT MEASURES\nPatellar Provocation T ests\nIIIPatellar pain provocation tests (compression test, \nWaldron test phases 1 and 2, patellar grind test, and \nClarke’s sign) have shown low diagnostic val -\n Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy® \n Downloaded from www.jospt.org at on November 12, 2025.

The MDC95 has been established for healthy con -\ntrols (0.036 kg of force/kg of body mass) and those with PFP \n(0.034 kg of force/kg of body mass) ( TABLE 3 ).4\nIVQuadriceps strength testing with a mechanical dy -\nnanometer using a maximum voluntary isometric \ncontraction is highly reliable (ICC = 0.97-0.98) \n(TABLE 3 ).50\nA challenge is to measure hip and thigh strength to identify \nweakness. To date, isometric muscle testing with a handheld \ndynamometer has been the most widely used assessment \ntool.286 Proper testing methods are key to reliable and ac -\ncurate measurement ( TABLE 3 ).2,30,165\nMuscle Length T ests\nILimited data exist regarding hip flexor length and \nhip internal and external rotation ROM. Hamstra-\nWright et al130 theorized that limited hip external \nrotation could contribute to increased femoral internal rota -\ntion during weight-bearing activities and increased lateral \nPFJ loading.\nIIIPiva et al230 established interrater reliability for \ntests commonly used to assess flexibility in patients \nwith PFP. Hamstring, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, \nand iliotibial band length tests had poor to excellent reliabil -\nity, with ICCs ranging from 0.29 to 0.97 ( TABLE 3 ).16,230 Piva et \nal230 also performed a multivariate stepwise discriminant \nanalysis to determine which measures were best for distin -\nguishing between individuals with and without PFP. Of the \nflexibility measures, only the gastrocnemius and soleus \nlengths were identified. Weight-bearing ankle dorsiflexion \nROM was the only factor associated with an increased FPPA \nduring the SLS,242 suggesting that gastrocnemius length may \nimpact movement during the SLS.\nPFP Cluster of Findings\nIIIA cluster of findings using a combination of history \nelements and common physical examination tests \ncan be used to identify whether or not knee com -\nplaints are likely due to PFP.81 Décary et al81 proposed 2 clus -\nters based on age, pain location, and clinical examination to \nhelp in the diagnosis of PFP. These clusters had a +LR of 8.70 \n(95% CI: 5.20, 14.58). Similarly, 3 clusters were identified to \nexclude PFP (–LR = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.27) ( TABLE 4 ).\n Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy® \n Downloaded from www.jospt.org at on November 12, 2025.

The indi -\nvidual performs an isometric quadriceps muscle contraction while the therapist observes the movement of the patella, with and without slight pressure to the \nsuperior aspect of the patella.\niThe individual is supine, with knees extended. The therapist applies posteriorly directed pressure to the superior patella to tilt the patella anteriorly at its \ninferior pole.\njThe individual is supine, with knee extended.

The assessor \nneeds to be able to move around the individual during the assessment and to have uninterrupted access to the posterior aspect of the leg and foot. If an observa -\ntion cannot be made (eg, because of soft tissue swelling), indicate on the data sheet that the item was not scored. A 5-point Likert-type scale, where lower scores \nrepresent a more supinated foot position and higher scores represent a more pronated position, is used.\nlThe individual stands in a relaxed-stance position on both legs. A caliper is used to measure the width of the midfoot at the point of 50% of the total foot length. \nFollowing weight-bearing measurements, the individual is seated on the end of a table so that both lower legs hang in a perpendicular position to the floor, with \nthe feet non–weight bearing and the ankles slightly plantar flexed. In this position, the non–weight-bearing measurements of midfoot width are recorded.\nmThe individual is in weight bearing and the subtalar joint is positioned in a neutral position, based on the clinician’s palpation. The distance from the floor to \nthe navicular tubercle is then measured. The patient then relaxes from this position (ie, relaxed calcaneal stance) and the measure is repeated. The difference in \ndistance from the navicular tubercle to the floor in both positions represents the amount of navicular drop.\nnThe individual is sidelying, with both legs positioned at 45° of hip flexion and 90° of knee flexion, with the limb to be tested superior to the opposite limb. The \nindividual is instructed to lift the knee of the superior leg while keeping the heels in contact, so that the hip is in 20° of hip abduction. The dynamometer is \nlaterally positioned 5 cm above the lateral tibiofemoral joint line. To ensure that the individual is exerting a maximal effort, he or she is familiarized with the \nprocedure and receives verbal encouragement from the tester.\noThe individual is seated, with hips and knees in 90° of flexion. The distal tibia is secured to the dynamometer force arm just proximal to the lateral malleolus, \nand rigid straps are used to stabilize the thigh and pelvis. The axis of rotation is adjusted to align with the lateral epicondyle of the femur. To ensure that the \nindividual is exerting a maximal effort, he or she is familiarized with the procedure and receives verbal encouragement from the tester and visual feedback from \nthe dynamometer’s real-time force display. The individual performs 3 practice trials, and testing is initiated after 5 minutes of rest. For the test, the individual \nis instructed to maximally contract his or her quadriceps for 5 seconds. To avoid the influence of fatigue, the individual is given 2 to 3 minutes of rest between \ntrials. A quadriceps index is calculated as a strength test score after testing is completed: (involved-side maximum force/uninvolved-side maximum force) × 100.\npThe individual assumes a supine position on a mat table, with the hip of the tested leg flexed to 90° and the contralateral limb flush on the mat table. The knee \nof the tested leg is flexed to 90°. The clinician then extends the knee to the maximum position, per the patient’s tolerance. The stationary arm of the goniom -\neter is aligned with the greater trochanter. The axis of the goniometer is aligned with the lateral epicondyle of the knee.

The stationary arm of the goniometer is aligned with the fibular head. The axis of the goniometer is placed just distal to the lateral mal -\nleolus. The movable arm of the goniometer is aligned parallel with the plantar aspect of the calcaneus and fifth metatarsal. To measure gastrocnemius length, \nthe knee is extended to 0° and a measurement of ankle dorsiflexion is recorded. To measure soleus length, the knee is flexed to 45° and a measurement of ankle \ndorsiflexion is recorded.\nsThe individual assumes a sidelying position on a mat table, with the pelvis, trunk, and shoulders aligned in the vertical plane. The tested leg is positioned \nsuperiorly and the ipsilateral knee flexed to 90°. The clinician stabilizes the pelvis with the proximal hand while the inferior hand grasps just inferior to the \nknee. The clinician moves the individual’s ipsilateral hip first in flexion, then through abduction and extension, until the hip is positioned in midrange abduc -\ntion and neutral flexion and extension. The clinician then lowers the thigh into adduction (toward the table) until the thigh stops moving. A positive test is \nindicated when the thigh remains in an abducted position (above the horizontal) when the hip abductor muscles are not contracting.

The goal of trunk, hip, thigh, and lower extremity \nstrengthening and stretching exercises is to address muscle \nperformance deficits, movement coordination deficits, and \nmobility impairments. Exercise therapies consist of knee- \nand/or hip-targeted exercises performed in weight-bearing \nor non–weight-bearing positions, or both. Due to the het -\nerogeneous nature and combination of multiple interven -\ntions for the treatment of individuals with PFP, results are \noften provided based on combined interventions. Combined \ninterventions consist of 3 or more adjunctive interventions, \nsuch as foot orthoses, manual therapy, or patellar taping, \nwith exercise therapy. Finally, adjunctive interventions such \nas biophysical agents, gait retraining, and dry needling were \nreviewed in isolation from exercise therapies when possible.\nEach body of evidence was synthesized separately and then \noverall to support the overarching recommendation for each \nintervention. To maintain consistency with the most recent \ninternational expert consensus meeting on the treatment of \nPFP published in 2016,75 systematic reviews and RCTs were \nassigned levels of evidence. These levels of evidence corre -\nsponded with the respective AMSTAR and Physiotherapy \nEvidence Database (PEDro) scores: high quality (7/10 or \ngreater), moderate quality (4-6/10), and low quality (3/10 \nor less). Studies were assessed for outcomes in the short \nterm (less than 3 months), medium term (3-12 months), \nand long term (greater than 12 months), as described by \nLack et al.168\nSPECIFIC MODES OF EXERCISE THERAPY \nCOMPARED WITH CONTROL\nIA high-quality systematic review identified 38 level \nI and level II studies supporting combined inter -\nventions of exercise therapy, consisting of knee-\ntargeted exercise therapy or knee- and hip-targeted exercise \ntherapy, combined with foot orthoses, patellar taping, patel -\nlar mobilization, and/or vasti biofeedback for the treatment \nof PFP compared with no care or with placebo.143 Four ad -\nditional systematic reviews also support the use of combined \ninterventions for the treatment of PFP.54,164,168,289 Further, a \n2016 Cochrane review concluded that exercise therapy re -\nduces pain (SMD, –1.46; 95% CI: –2.39, –0.54) and improves \nfunction (SMD, 1.62; 95% CI: 0.31, 2.94) with moderate to large effect sizes, when compared with control or sham thera -\npies, in the short term.290 In the medium to long term, exer -\ncise therapy results in large reductions in usual pain (SMD, \n4.32; 95% CI: 0.89, 7.75) and large improvements in function \n(SMD, 1.1; 95% CI: 0.58, 1.63) in individuals with PFP, when \ncompared with control or sham therapies.290\nGaps in Knowledge\nAlthough exercise therapy is recommended for PFP to reduce \npain in the short, medium, and long term, and to improve \nfunction in the medium and long term, optimal dosage is \ncurrently unclear, in part due to inadequate exercise report -\ning in the literature.143 Further research is needed to under -\nstand which dosage parameters (eg, session duration and \nfrequency, exercise intensity, etc) are associated with better \npain, function, and quality-of-life outcomes.\nKnee- T argeted Exercise Therapy\nNon–Weight Bearing (Open Chain) Versus Weight Bearing \n(Closed Chain)\nEvidence suggests that weight-bearing and non–weight-bear -\ning quadriceps-strengthening exercises result in differential \npatterns of PFJ loading.98,239 Therefore, non–weight-bearing \nand weight-bearing exercises each have theoretical advantag -\nes and disadvantages that may influence a patient’s response.\nShort-term Outcomes\nIITwo moderate-quality RCTs have compared short-\nterm outcomes in individuals with PFP who com -\npleted programs of either non–weight-bearing or \nweight-bearing knee-targeted exercises. In a moderate-qual -\nity RCT, Herrington and Al-Sherhi135 reported equivalent \nreductions in pain and improvement in function at 6 weeks \nin individuals who completed weight-bearing versus non–\nweight-bearing knee-targeted exercises. Most importantly, \nboth weight-bearing and non–weight-bearing knee-targeted \nexercises were superior to control (wait and see).135\nSimilarly, a moderate-quality RCT by Bakhtiary and Fatemi14 \nreported large pain reductions in individuals with PFP who \ncompleted a 6-week program of either non–weight-bearing \nor weight-bearing knee-targeted (quadriceps-strengthening) \nexercises, with no differences between the 2 exercise modes. \nBakhtiary and Fatemi14 did not include a no-intervention \ncontrol group, and therefore it is unclear whether findings of \npain reductions in either exercise group would exceed “wait \nand see.”CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\nInterventions\n Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy® \n Downloaded from www.jospt.org at on November 12, 2025.

They reported no differences \nin functional outcomes between the 2 groups in the medium \nterm.314 However, it should be noted that there was no control \ngroup. Therefore, it is unclear whether medium-term out -\ncomes for either weight-bearing or non–weight-bearing knee-\ntargeted exercises are greater than “wait and see.”\nLong-term Outcomes\nIFive-year outcomes from a high-quality RCT312 re-\nported that while both non–weight-bearing and \nweight-bearing exercises reduced PFP, neither was \nsuperior. At the 5-year follow-up, slightly higher functional \nscores on the AKPS were reported in those treated with non–\nweight-bearing exercises.\nGaps in Knowledge\nWhile neither weight-bearing nor non–weight-bearing \nknee-targeted exercise therapy demonstrated superiority \ncompared to one another in the short, medium, and long \nterm,132,164,250,289 it is not yet known whether either is superior \nto control in the medium and long term.\nHigh Versus Low Volume of Knee- T argeted \nExercise Therapy While Avoiding Pain\nIIA single moderate-quality RCT reported greater \nshort- and medium-to-long-term reductions in pain \nand improvements in function with the step-down \ntest using a high-volume (3 sets of 30 or more repetitions, 3 \ntimes per week for 12 weeks), knee-targeted exercise therapy \nprogram (deloaded, unweighted) that avoided any pain exacer -\nbation; it was coupled with 30 minutes of aerobic cycling and \ncompared with a low-volume exercise program (3 sets of 10 rep -\netitions, 3 times per week for 12 weeks) that also avoided pain \nexacerbation and included 10 minutes of aerobic cycling.217,218,289\nGaps in Knowledge\nThe cited evidence to support high-volume exercise is from \na single cohort and lacked a control group of wait and see. \nThus, additional research is needed to make a definitive \nrecommendation regarding high- versus low-volume knee-\ntargeted exercise therapy.\nHip- T argeted Exercise Therapy Compared With Control\nShort-term Outcomes\nIIA single moderate-quality RCT compared a group \nthat received 8 weeks of non–weight-bearing, hip-\ntargeted exercise therapy utilizing elastic bands to a group that received a control therapy of nutritional supple -\nmentation for the treatment of PFP.159 In the short term, large \nreductions in pain (SMD, 2.80; 95% CI: 1.71, 3.88) and im -\nprovements in function on the WOMAC (SMD, 2.88; 95% \nCI: 1.78, 3.98) were reported for the hip-targeted exercise \ntherapy group when compared with the control.\nGaps in Knowledge\nDue to the moderate quality of evidence supporting hip-tar -\ngeted exercise therapy compared with control, further high-\nquality RCTs evaluating the efficacy of hip-targeted exercise \ntherapy in the medium and long term, along with consider -\nation of optimal dosage parameters, may allow a more defini -\ntive recommendation.\nHip- T argeted Exercise Therapy Compared \nWith Knee- T argeted Exercise Therapy\nShort-term Outcomes\nIA high-quality RCT assessed an 8-week interven -\ntion of hip-targeted exercises compared with knee-\ntargeted exercises and reported superior outcomes \nfor pain and function in the group that completed the hip-\ntargeted exercises.84 It should be noted that weight-bearing \nexercises, including leg presses, step-downs/step-ups, and \nsquats, were considered, in addition to resisted non–weight-\nbearing knee extension exercises, to be knee-targeted exer -\ncises. Indeed, these weight-bearing exercises result in high \nlevels of gluteal activity.251 The hip-targeted exercise group \ncompleted exercises that included non–weight-bearing hip-\nstrengthening exercises but also several weight-bearing exer -\ncises, such as the SLS and lunges, that have previously been \nreported to result in high levels of quadriceps muscle activity \n(greater than 50% to 60% maximal voluntary isometric \ncontraction).26,104\nIIn a high-quality RCT,3 individuals with PFP ran -\ndomized to 4 weeks of isolated hip-targeted exer -\ncise therapy prior to 4 weeks of isolated \nknee-targeted exercise therapy experienced greater improve -\nments in hopping performance and functional scores (via the \nKujala questionnaire) compared with individuals who re -\nceived 4 weeks of knee-targeted exercise therapy prior to 4 \nweeks of hip-targeted exercise therapy. Regardless of group \nassignment, all exercises were performed for 3 sets of 10 rep -\netitions at 60% of 10-repetition maximum.\nITwo high-quality meta-analyses found small short-\nterm effects favoring hip-targeted exercises over \nknee-targeted exercises for improving pain (SMD, \n0.36; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.59) and function (SMD, 0.18; 95% CI: \n0.05, 0.42) in individuals with PFP.168,289 Caution is urged, as \nthese meta-analyses included the studies by Ferber et al105 \nand de Marche Baldon et al84 as hip-targeted exercises versus \n Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy® \n Downloaded from www.jospt.org at on November 12, 2025.

Finally, greater consistency in \nthe delineation of hip-targeted exercise therapy and knee-\ntargeted exercise therapy will assist with interpretation and \nimplementation of results from future clinical trials.\nCombined Hip- and Knee- T argeted Exercise Therapy \nCompared With Knee- T argeted Exercise Therapy Alone\nShort-term Outcomes\nICompared with knee-targeted exercise therapy, 3 \nhigh-quality meta-analyses agree that the combina -\ntion of hip- and knee-targeted exercise therapy re -\nsulted in better outcomes in the short term.168,204,289 \nSpecifically, 1 meta-analysis found small effects favoring com -\nbined hip- and knee-targeted exercises compared with knee-\ntargeted exercises with respect to usual pain (SMD, 0.55; \n95% CI: 0.22, 0.59) and patient-reported function (SMD, \n0.42; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.81).168 However, it is noteworthy that \nthe majority of the RCTs included in the meta-analyses did \nnot control for exercise volume in the respective knee-target -\ned and combined hip- and knee-targeted exercise protocols. \nTherefore, the differences in patient outcomes may be due to \ngreater exercise volume in the combined hip- and knee-tar -\ngeted exercise protocols.\nMedium-term Outcomes\nIBased on 2 high-quality RCTs,90,107 2 high-quality \nmeta-analyses reported large effects for pain reduc -\ntion in the medium term in favor of combined hip- \nand knee-targeted exercise therapy over knee-targeted \nexercise therapy.168,289 Similarly, these meta-analyses168,289 \nreported large effects in favor of combined hip- and knee-\ntargeted exercise therapy for improvements in patient-re -\nported function, based on 2 high-quality RCTs.90,107 A \nhigh-quality RCT reported a large effect in favor of combined \nhip- and knee-targeted exercise therapy over knee-only exer -\ncise therapy on single-leg hop scores in the medium term \n(SMD, 1.54; 95% CI: 0.89, 2.18).107\nLong-term Outcomes\nITo date, only 1 high-quality RCT compared long-\nterm outcomes for pain, patient-reported function, \nand functional performance between patients who \nreceived either combined hip- and knee-targeted exercise \ntherapy or knee-only targeted exercise therapy. Fukuda et \nal107 reported a large effect in favor of combined hip- and \nknee-targeted exercise therapy over knee-targeted exercise \nalone on pain reduction (SMD, 2.99; 95% CI: 2.16, 3.83), \npatient-reported function on the LEFS (SMD, 2.65; 95% CI: \n1.86, 3.43) and AKPS (SMD, 1.78; 95% CI: 1.12, 2.45), and on \nthe single-leg hop test (SMD, 2.1; 95% CI: 1.40, 2.79).knee-targeted exercises, despite the confounding nature of \ntheir respective exercise programs.\nIIIn a moderate-quality trial, Ferber et al105 reported \nthat 6 weeks of hip-targeted exercises or knee-tar -\ngeted exercises both reduced pain and improved \nfunction via AKPS scores in individuals with PFP, but there \nwere no differences between the groups. The hip-targeted ex -\nercise group performed standing exercises that used a cable \ncolumn to provide external resistance to the hip abductors and \nhip internal and external rotator musculature. The knee-tar -\ngeted exercise group performed non–weight-bearing and \nweight-bearing exercises. Non–weight-bearing exercises in -\ncluded isometric quadriceps exercises and knee extension ex -\nercises, whereas weight-bearing exercises included step-downs, \nthe SLS and double-leg squats, and forward lunges. Care \nshould be taken when interpreting the findings,105 as high lev -\nels of hip muscle activity (greater than 60% maximal voluntary \nisometric contraction) were previously reported in the weight-\nbearing knee exercises used in this study.99,251 No wait-and-see \ncontrol group was included in this study.105\nIITwo moderate- and 1 high-quality RCTs compared \nhip exercises that targeted the posterolateral hip \nmusculature (eg, sidelying hip abduction) to knee-\ntargeted exercises that targeted the quadriceps musculature \n(eg, non–weight-bearing knee extension).90,105,158 All 3 studies \nreported that hip-targeted exercise therapy resulted in supe -\nrior outcomes relating to pain reduction and improved func -\ntion compared with knee-targeted exercise therapy.\nIn contrast, a moderate-quality RCT31 found improvements \nin pain and function, assessed via a VAS and the AKPS, in \nindividuals who received 6 weeks of either knee-targeted \nexercise therapy or hip- and core-targeted exercise therapy. \nHowever, there were no between-group differences. Because \na control group was not included, it is unknown whether im -\nprovements with either exercise protocol were greater than \n“wait and see.”\nMedium-term Outcomes\nIBased on 2 high-quality RCTs,83,158 a 2015 high-\nquality systematic review concluded that hip-tar -\ngeted exercise resulted in medium effects of greater \npain reduction (SMD, 1.07; 95% CI: 0.55, 1.59) and PROMs \n(SMD, 0.87; 95% CI: 0.36, 1.37) compared with knee-target -\ned exercise in the medium term.167\nGaps in Knowledge\nWhile short- and medium-term outcomes favor hip-target -\ned exercise therapy over knee-targeted therapy, long-term \noutcomes are currently unknown.

For example, Callaghan and Selfe’s42 Co-\nchrane review reported no benefit from taping, but defined \n“short term” as 3 months or less and pooled findings of vari -\nous taping techniques and time points from 1 week to 3 \nmonths. Collins et al60 and Barton et al15 considered taping \ntechniques and time points separately. Both reviews report -\ned limited evidence from 1 high-quality study305 indicating \nthat tailored patellar taping combined with exercise pro -\nduces large reductions in pain (effect size unable to be esti -\nmated, as the taping group was pain free) in the short term \n(4 weeks). Additionally, these reviews reported limited evi -\ndence from 1 high-quality study53 that combining medially \ndirected, untailored taping does not provide any additional \nbenefit to exercise and education, or education alone. Tap -\ning applied with the aim of enhancing muscle function does \nnot provide any benefits in relation to pain and function \nwhen combined with exercise therapy.15\nIIA 2018 moderate-quality RCT reported no added \nimprovements in pain or function when patellar \ntaping was combined with intensive physical ther -\napy (12 sessions over 4 weeks), including knee-targeted exer -\ncise and manual therapy.114 However, interpretation of how \nto apply these findings is challenging because taping methods \nwere poorly described in this study.\nIIA 2017 moderate-quality RCT reported equivalent \noutcomes for pain or function after comparing su -\npervised exercise therapy targeting the hip and \nknee (12 sessions over 6 weeks), when combined with taping \nto facilitate medial quadriceps activity, to sham taping and \nno taping.123\nGaps in Knowledge\nAlthough tailored patellar taping in conjunction with exer -\ncise therapy appears to improve outcomes in the short term \nfor individuals with PFP, long-term evaluation of taping ap -\nproaches for PFP is needed.\nRecommendation\nBClinicians may use tailored patellar taping in com -\nbination with exercise therapy to assist in immedi -\nate pain reduction, and to enhance outcomes of \nexercise therapy in the short term (4 weeks). Importantly, \ntaping techniques may not be beneficial in the longer term or \nwhen added to more intensive physical therapy. Taping ap -\nplied with the aim of enhancing muscle function is not \nrecommended.Gaps in Knowledge\nMore high-quality RCTs are needed in specialized popula -\ntions, such as high-demand athletes or adolescents, and to \ndetermine optimal dosage parameters for combined hip- and \nknee-targeted exercise. Future RCTs should also match exer -\ncise volume between knee-targeted and combined hip- and \nknee-targeted exercise programs.\nRecommendation\nAClinicians should include exercise therapy with \ncombined hip- and knee-targeted exercises in the \ntreatment of individuals with PFP to reduce pain \nand improve patient-reported outcomes and functional per -\nformance in the short, medium, and long term. Hip-target -\ned exercise therapy should target the posterolateral hip \nmusculature. Knee-targeted exercise therapy includes ei -\nther weight-bearing (resisted squats) or non–weight-bear -\ning (resisted knee extension) exercise, as both exercise \ntechniques target the knee musculature. Preference to hip-\ntargeted exercise over knee-targeted exercise may be given \nin the early stages of treatment of PFP. Overall, the combi -\nnation of hip- and knee-targeted exercises is preferred over \nsolely knee-targeted exercises to optimize outcomes in pa -\ntients with PFP.\nPatellar T aping\nMany taping protocols for individuals with PFP have been \nproposed and evaluated in the literature, with each aimed \nat altering PFJ kinematics to reduce PFJ stress.67 Common \nmethods include the tailored McConnell taping technique, \nwhere rigid taping is applied with the aim of reducing any \ncombination of lateral patellar glide, tilt, and rotation,67 \nto reduce pain during a functional task (eg, step-down) \nduring the clinical consultation. Other common methods \ninclude untailored medial patellar glide–only taping156 and \ntaping aimed at enhancing vastii muscle activation and \nsynergy.176\nIPooled data from 6 high-quality studies indicate \nthat tailored patellar taping provides large reduc -\ntions in pain (SMD, 2.43; 95% CI: 1.98, 2.89) dur -\ning a range of functional tasks in the immediate term.15 \nSpecifically, tailored patellar taping involves a combination \nof techniques to support patellar tilt, glide, and rotation, tai -\nlored to optimize pain outcomes during a functional task (eg, \nstep-down). Pooled data from 3 high-quality studies indicate \nthat untailored medially directed taping (ie, 1 strip of tape) \nproduces immediate, small pain reductions (SMD, 0.50; 95% \nCI: 0.22, 0.79) during functional tasks.\nIThere are conflicting findings from 4 high-quality \nsystematic reviews regarding the potential value \nof patellar taping beyond the immediate \n Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy® \n Downloaded from www.jospt.org at on November 12, 2025.

None of the clinical prediction studies \nhave been validated with appropriate follow-up methodology, \nindicating that further work is necessary before guidance on \nwho is most likely to benefit from foot orthoses can be pro -\nvided to help guide clinical practice.Patellofemoral Knee Orthoses (Bracing)\nIComparing patellofemoral knee orthoses (knee \nbrace, sleeve, or a patellar strap) plus exercise ther -\napy versus exercise therapy alone, a high-quality \n2015 Cochrane review267 concluded that patellofemoral knee \northoses did not have a meaningful effect on pain in the short \nterm (mean difference, –0.46; 95% CI: –1.16, 0.24). The Co -\nchrane review noted the very low quality of evidence and \nheterogeneity of the types of braces (knee brace, sleeve, and \nstrap) across the various studies.267\nGaps in Knowledge\nConsidering the low quality of research on patellofemoral \nknee orthoses, further high-quality clinical trials are needed \nto compare the impact of different types of braces on pain \nand functional outcomes when combined with exercise.\nRecommendation\nBClinicians should not use patellofemoral knee or -\nthoses, including braces, sleeves, or straps, for the \ntreatment of individuals with PFP.\nFoot Orthoses\nThe presence of excessive static or dynamic foot pronation has \ntraditionally been the rationale for prescribing foot orthoses \nfor individuals with PFP122; however, the results are inconsis -\ntent. Some studies indicate a likelihood of success with signs \nof greater dynamic pronation22 or foot mobility,21,196,273,296 some \nreport success with signs of less foot mobility,21,196,273,296 and \nothers report success unrelated to foot posture and mobil -\nity.21,196,273,296 Based on moderate- and high-quality systematic \nreviews and panel voting, the 2016 international expert con -\nsensus meeting75 concluded that prescribing prefabricated foot \northoses may be useful for short-term pain reduction.\nIA high-quality Cochrane review of 2 studies involv -\ning 210 participants reported that foot orthoses \nresulted in better improvements in knee pain (risk \nratio = 1.48; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.99) compared with flat orthoses \nat the 6-week time point, but not at 1-year follow-up.145 The \ncombination of physical therapy and foot orthosis interven -\ntion demonstrated no significantly greater improvements in \nPROMs than physical therapy alone at any time point.\nIA high-quality systematic review by Matthews et \nal189 reported 14 factors associated with a successful \noutcome after foot orthosis treatment across 6 \nstudies. Barton et al21 reported that the presence of any 3 of \n4 predictors (footwear motion-control properties greater \nthan 5.0, usual pain on a VAS less than 22.0/100 mm, weight-\nbearing ankle dorsiflexion ROM less than 41.3° with the knee \nflexed, and reduced pain during the SLS) increased the likeli -\nhood of success for foot orthoses for PFP by 11.1 times (95% \n Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy® \n Downloaded from www.jospt.org at on November 12, 2025.

The running modifica -\ntion education consisted of instruction to increase running \ncadence, reduce audible sound of foot strike, and/or alter foot \nstrike from rearfoot to forefoot. However, combining patient \neducation on load management with running modification \nwas no more effective in the medium term than patient edu -\ncation on load management alone for runners with PFP, and \nwas no more effective than hip- and knee-targeted exercise \ntherapy plus patient education.100 There was no control group \nincluded in this study. Therefore, it is unknown whether the \nimprovements noted with the 3 interventions exceeded “wait \nand see.”\nIIIn a moderate-quality RCT, 8 sessions of gait re -\ntraining over 2 weeks in rearfoot-strike runners, \nconsisting of cuing to alter foot strike from rearfoot \nto forefoot using a faded-feedback design, were more effec -\ntive at reducing pain immediately following the conclusion of \nthe retraining period and at short-term follow-up (4 weeks) \ncompared with a control group that received a graded in -\ncrease in running volume matching the gait retraining \ngroup.252\nIIA moderate-quality RCT reported that runners \ntreated with 10 sessions of gait retraining to in -\ncrease running cadence by 10%, combined with the \nuse of minimalist, barefoot-mimicking footwear for 20% of \nrunning volume, had greater pain reductions compared with \nrunners treated with foot orthoses prescribed to optimize \ncomfort.35\nIIIA 2016 systematic review based on 2 moderate-\nquality case series212,309 concluded that 8 sessions of \ngait retraining using visual feedback and a faded-\nfeedback design on what were deemed to be excessive proxi -\nmal running mechanics (ie, peak hip adduction) during \nrunning resulted in large reductions in pain as assessed with \na VAS (SMD, 3.84; 95% CI: 2.70, 4.98), with concurrent \nlarge increases in function as measured by the LEFS (SMD, \n2.16; 95% CI: 1.29, 3.03).206\nGaps in Knowledge\nFurther research should include comparisons of running gait \nretraining, patient education, and hip- and knee-targeted ex -\nercise therapy, with an adequate length of interventions and \nlong-term follow-up. It should be determined whether gait \nretraining needs to be targeted to a specific running mecha -\nnism thought to contribute to the etiology of PFP, or whether Recommendation\nAClinicians should prescribe prefabricated foot or -\nthoses for those with greater than normal prona -\ntion to reduce pain in individuals with PFP, but \nonly in the short term (up to 6 weeks). If prescribed, foot \northoses should be combined with an exercise therapy pro -\ngram. There is insufficient evidence to recommend custom \nfoot orthoses over prefabricated foot orthoses.\nBiofeedback\nEMG-Based Biofeedback-Assisted Knee Exercise Therapy\nIIElectromyography-based biofeedback has been pro -\nposed to encourage preferential recruitment of the \nmedial vastii musculature to reduce lateral patello -\nfemoral tracking in individuals with PFP.180 Two moderate-\nquality RCTs have examined whether EMG-based biofeedback \ncan improve therapeutic outcomes in individuals with PFP; \nboth reported no added benefit over knee-targeted (quadri -\nceps) exercise alone.94,321 Subsequent low- and high-quality \nmeta-analyses concluded that biofeedback-assisted quadriceps \nexercise therapy had no added benefit over knee-targeted \n(quadriceps) exercise therapy alone for the treatment of PFP. \nBecause there was no control group in these studies, it is not \npossible to determine whether the knee-targeted exercise pro -\ngrams used in these studies were superior to wait and see.60,169,299\nRecommendation\nBClinicians should not use EMG-based biofeed -\nback on medial vastii activity to augment knee-\ntargeted (quadriceps) exercise therapy for the \ntreatment of PFP.\nHip- and Knee- T argeted Exercise Therapy Completed With \nVisual Biofeedback Compared With Hip- and Knee- T argeted \nExercise Therapy in the Absence of Visual Biofeedback\nShort-term and Medium-term Outcomes\nIA single high-quality RCT found that improvements \nin reported pain and function (assessed via the AKPS) \nwere noted after 4 weeks of rehabilitation and at 3 \nand 6 months post rehabilitation in individuals with PFP, re -\ngardless of whether visual biofeedback on lower extremity \nalignment was provided during combined hip and knee exer -\ncises, such as the SLS.90 Furthermore, there were no differences \nin trunk and lower extremity mechanics between the 2 treat -\nment groups during a single-leg step-down task after rehabilita -\ntion was completed.

These include acupuncture (East -\nern medicine) and dry needling (Western medicine). While \nacupuncture is not practiced by physical therapists in the \nUnited States, it is practiced by physical therapists in other \ncountries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia.\nIA single high-quality RCT reported no added im -\nprovements in patient pain or function after 3 ses -\nsions of trigger point dry needling of the vastii \nmusculature when combined with knee exercise therapy and \nmanual therapy targeting the PFJ.102\nIA single high-quality RCT comparing trigger point \ndry needling (6 sites in the quadriceps) to sham \n(same 6 sites using a sharp object with a plastic \nguide tube, but not puncturing the skin) reported no benefit \nof dry needling on pain or disability in individuals with PFP \nimmediately or 72 hours following treatment.273\nIIA single moderate-quality RCT, synthesized in a \nhigh-quality systematic review, indicates that acu -\npuncture produces a moderate positive effect on \npain reduction compared to no treatment in the medium \nterm (5 months) (SMD, 0.65; 95% CI: 0.13, 1.16).60\nEvidence Synthesis and Gaps in Knowledge\nAlthough 1 study points to the effectiveness of acupunc -\nture, this was in comparison to no treatment, highlighting \nthe need for a placebo/sham-controlled trial. Additionally, \nacupuncture has not been evaluated in comparison to, or in \ncombination with, exercise therapy. Therefore, it is unclear \nwhether similar findings to those identified with dry needling \nmay occur (ie, no added value to exercise therapy). No stud -\nies have compared acupuncture to dry needling approaches \nin individuals with PFP. These gaps in research should be \naddressed to allow clearer recommendations in relation to \nacupuncture.\nRecommendations\nAClinicians should not use dry needling for the treat -\nment of individuals with PFP.gait retraining can be applied evenly across runners regard -\nless of running mechanics. It is currently unknown which cri -\nteria identify patients with PFP who would benefit the most \nfrom the addition of gait retraining to their rehabilitation \nprograms. Because the retraining interventions that resulted \nin a reduction in pain were associated with more intensive re -\ntraining (ie, more retraining sessions), future research should \nalso assess optimal dosage of retraining sessions. With the \nmajority of this research involving small RCTs (10 per group) \nor case series, it is unclear which gait retraining intervention \nis most effective, and whether it is superior to patient educa -\ntion on load management.\nRecommendation\nCClinicians may use gait retraining consisting of \nmultiple sessions of cuing to adopt a forefoot-strike \npattern (for rearfoot-strike runners), cuing to in -\ncrease running cadence, or cuing to reduce peak hip adduc -\ntion while running for runners with PFP.\nBlood Flow Restriction Training Plus High-\nRepetition Knee- T argeted Exercise Therapy\nIA single level I high-quality RCT reported no dif -\nference in Kujala score or worst pain between \nhealthy adults with PFP who received 8 weeks of \nstandard knee exercise therapy (3 sets of 7 to 10 repetitions \nat approximately 70% of 1-repetition maximum) and those \nwho received 8 weeks of blood flow restriction training plus \nhigh-repetition knee exercise therapy (1 set of 30 repetitions \nor volitional failure, followed by 3 sets of 15 repetitions, all at \n30% of 1-repetition maximum).115 While a significantly great -\ner reduction in pain VAS score during ADLs was observed in \nthe blood flow restriction group compared with standard \nknee-targeted exercise therapy, between-group differences on \nthe VAS did not exceed the MCID (20 mm).58 A subgroup \nanalysis revealed that those with painful resisted knee exten -\nsion experienced greater increases in quadriceps strength \nwith blood flow restriction therapy plus knee exercise therapy \nthan did those who received only standard knee exercise \ntherapy.\nEvidence Synthesis and Gaps in Knowledge\nAdditional studies are required to make a definitive recom -\nmendation regarding the use of blood flow restriction train -\ning in conjunction with high-repetition knee exercise therapy \nfor the treatment of individuals with PFP. Future high-quali -\nty RCTs should utilize appropriately powered sample sizes to \nmore clearly identify subgroups of people, such as individu -\nals with painful resisted knee extension, who may experience \ngreater improvements with blood flow restriction training \nand across various demographics.

With most of the current \nevidence relating to single moderate-quality RCTs, further \nhigh-quality RCTs evaluating the efficacy of combining man -\nual therapy with exercise therapy are needed to allow more \ndefinitive recommendations.\nEvidence Synthesis and Clinical Rationale\nBased on evidence from high-quality systematic reviews and \npanel voting, the most recent international expert consensus \nmeeting75 concluded that manual therapy, including lumbar, \nknee, or patellofemoral manipulation/mobilization, may \nnot improve outcomes, particularly when used in isolation. \nAlthough manual therapy has been used in evidence-based \ncombined interventions, its use may not improve outcomes, \nparticularly when used in isolation, and thus is not recom -\nmended. Because exercise therapy is the consistent com -\nponent in combined intervention studies, manual therapy \nshould not reduce the time available to provide appropriate \nexercise therapy in patients with PFP.\nRecommendation\nAClinicians should not use manual therapy, includ -\ning lumbar, knee, or patellofemoral manipulation/\nmobilization, in isolation for patients with PFP.\nBiophysical Agents\nNeuromuscular Electrical Stimulation–Assisted Quadriceps Exer -\ncise Therapy Compared With Quadriceps Exercise Therapy Alone\nIIA single moderate-quality RCT reported no added \nbenefit of neuromuscular electrical stimulation tar -\ngeting the vastus medialis musculature plus knee-\ntargeted (quadriceps) exercise therapy when compared to \nexercise therapy alone.27\nIIA low-quality systematic review subsequently con -\ncluded that neuromuscular electrical stimulation \ndoes not have any added benefit when combined \nwith quadriceps exercise therapy for the treatment of PFP.169\nUltrasound and Other Electrophysical Agents\nBased on evidence from low- and moderate-quality system -\natic reviews and panel voting, the 2016 international expert \nconsensus meeting75 concluded that ultrasound and other \nelectrophysical agents may not improve outcomes.\nIIA low-quality systematic review of 12 studies evalu -\nated the use of several different electrophysical \nagents for PFP treatment.169 One low-quality study CClinicians may use acupuncture to reduce pain in \nindividuals with PFP. However, caution should be \nexercised with this recommendation, as the superi -\nority of acupuncture over placebo or sham treatments is un -\nknown. This recommendation should only be incorporated \nin settings where acupuncture is within the scope of practice \nof physical therapy.\nManual Therapy as a Stand-Alone Treatment\nA 2018 low-quality systematic review concluded that there \nis no benefit from manual therapy (patellar or lumbar) in \nisolation.150\nPatellar mobilization has been combined with other physical \ntherapy interventions with reported effectiveness. There is a \nhigh degree of variance in the practice of manual therapy in \nclinical practice and when evaluated in research, with each \nhaving different rationales for its use, including improved lo -\ncal and remote joint mobility and reduced muscle and fascial \ntension.\nIA high-quality RCT reported greater reduction in \npain following retropatellar and peripatellar isch -\nemic pressure (15 sessions) compared to hip mus -\nculature ischemic pressure (15 sessions), but no control group \nwas included.127\nIIA low-quality RCT226 synthesized in 2 systematic \nreviews (1 of high quality and the other of low qual -\nity)60,150 concluded that 2 weeks of treatment with \nmedial glides, tilt mobilizations, and local lateral retinacular \nmassages did not result in reduced levels of pain when com -\npared with a no-intervention control.\nIIA moderate-quality RCT269 synthesized in a high-\nquality systematic review60 yielded no benefit by \nadding spinal manipulation to patellar mobiliza -\ntion over 4 weeks.\nIIA moderate-quality RCT reported greater reduction \nin resting pain when exercise was combined with \nknee mobilization with movement (tibiofemoral) \ncompared to exercise combined with an elastic taping \nmethod.85\nIIA moderate-quality RCT reported that the addition \nof 12 patellar taping applications may be more ben -\neficial for reducing pain than 12 sessions of patellar \nmobilization, when combined with an exercise program of \nstretching and combined knee- and hip-targeted exercise.160 \nThe time frame for delivery of these sessions could not be \ndetermined.\n Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy® \n Downloaded from www.jospt.org at on November 12, 2025.

Pa -\ntient education may improve compliance and adherence to \nactive management and self-management strategies and is \nunlikely to have adverse effects.\nCombined Interventions\nCombined interventions consist of combining 3 or more of \nthe following interventions: foot orthoses, EMG biofeedback \nfor vastii retraining, patellar mobilizations, patellar taping, \nand exercise therapy.\nShort-term Outcomes\nIBased on 2 high-quality RCTs,57,68 a high-quality \nmeta-analysis concluded that 6 weeks of combined \ninterventions (knee- and hip-targeted exercise \ntherapy combined with directional patellar taping, patellar \nmobilizations, and EMG biofeedback) is superior to placebo \n(sham shoe inserts or sham physical therapy), with moderate \neffects (SMD, 1.08; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.43).60 Exercise therapy \ncombined with foot orthoses resulted in significant moderate \neffects for pain reduction compared with foot orthoses \nalone.23,57\nMedium-term Outcomes\nICombined interventions, consisting of patellar tap -\ning, EMG biofeedback for the quadriceps muscula -\nture, knee-targeted exercise therapy, patellar \nmobilizations, and lower-limb stretching plus foot orthoses, \nresulted in significant moderate effects for pain reduction \ncompared with foot orthoses alone.23,56 In the medium to long \nterm, combined interventions that included exercise therapy \nresulted in large reductions in usual pain (SMD, 4.32; 95% \nCI: 0.89, 7.75) and large improvements in function (SMD, \n1.1; 95% CI: 0.58, 1.63) in individuals with PFP compared \nwith control or sham therapies.290\nLong-term Outcomes\nISix weeks of combined interventions, consisting of \npatellar taping, patellar mobilizations, EMG bio -\nfeedback for the quadriceps musculature, knee-\ntargeted exercise therapy, and lower-limb stretching, \nresulted in a moderate treatment effect (SMD, 0.44; 95% \nCI: 0.01, 0.88) with respect to pain compared with placebo \nshoe inserts or foot orthoses at 1-year follow-up.60 Adding \nfoot orthoses to the same 6-week combined intervention \nalso resulted in a moderate effect (SMD, 0.77; 95% CI: 0.33, \n1.21) compared with placebo at 1-year follow-up. However, evaluated the effects of multimodal interventions (ultrasound \nand ice massage, ice bags, phonophoresis, and iontophoresis) \non symptoms and thigh muscle strength, functional mea -\nsures, and thigh muscle activation; 3 studies evaluated the \neffects of electrical stimulation on pain; and 1 study reported \non the effects of laser therapy. This review reported no ad -\nditional benefits from these electrophysical agents for the \nmanagement of PFP.\nRecommendation\nBClinicians should not use biophysical agents, in -\ncluding ultrasound, cryotherapy, phonophoresis, \niontophoresis, electrical stimulation, and therapeu -\ntic laser, for the treatment of patients with PFP.\nPatient Education\nCurrently, there is no evidence from RCTs to support the \nbenefits of education compared to control, wait and see, \nor in addition to interventions such as exercise therapy \nwhen treating PFP. Previous investigations evaluating pa -\ntient education have used it as a comparison intervention \nor in addition to other interventions like exercise therapy. \nThe majority of this research generally indicates that com -\nbining exercise therapy with education produces superior \noutcomes to education alone.53,198,247,268,292 However, the \nspecifics of education provided in these studies are not \nclear, and, as such, value and quality are unable to be de -\ntermined. In a recent moderate-quality RCT by Esculier et \nal100 in runners with PFP, education related to load man -\nagement alone produced similar outcomes for running-\nrelated pain when compared with education combined \nwith 8 weeks of exercise therapy, and education combined \nwith running retraining primarily focused on increasing \ncadence. This highlights the potential value of education, \nbut more research is needed in this area. Regardless of the \nlimited evidence base to support patient education in the \nmanagement of PFP, international experts suggest that it \nmay be the key to successful management.18\nGaps in Knowledge\nDue to the limited and low quality of evidence available, \nfurther research is needed to determine the effectiveness of \npatient education for individuals with PFP. It is presently \nunknown whether tailored patient education is superior to \nuniversal patient education. Recently, it was determined that \ntailored online education delivered every other week was \nmore effective than a single session of general education on \ninjury prevention strategies for runners136; however, the ef -\nfects on risk of PFP were not studied. Thus, the most effective \nfrequency and mode of delivery of patient education are also \nin need of further study.\n Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy® \n Downloaded from www.jospt.org at on November 12, 2025.

Medical conditions for which physical therapy is \nnot indicated must be considered as possible etiologies of a \npatient’s symptoms.\nComponent 2\nDifferential evaluation of musculoskeletal clinical findings \ndetermines the most relevant physical impairments associat -\ned with the patient’s reported activity limitations and medical \ndiagnosis.157 Clusters of these clinical findings are described \nas impairment patterns in the physical therapy literature, \nand are labeled according to the key impairment(s) of body \nfunction associated with that cluster. The authors propose a \nclassification system for PFP, with subcategories named ac -\ncording to the primary impairments. These impairment-pat -\ntern subcategories for PFP are described in the Diagnosis and \nClassification sections of this CPG. The ICD-10 and primary \nand secondary ICF codes associated with PFP are provided \nin the Methods section of this CPG. These impairment pat -\nterns impact the selection of interventions, which focus on \nnormalizing the key impairments of body function, which in \nturn should improve the movement and function of the pa -\ntient and lessen or alleviate the activity limitations commonly \nreported by the patients who meet the diagnostic criteria of \nthat specific pattern. The FIGURE  lists the key clinical findings \nused to rule in or rule out the common impairment patterns \nand their associated medical conditions. Impairment-based \nclassification is critical for matching the intervention strat -\negy that is most likely to provide the optimal outcome for \na patient’s clinical findings.157 However, it is important for \nclinicians to understand that the impairment pattern, the \nmost relevant impairments of body function, and the associ -\nated intervention strategies often change during the patient’s \nepisode of care. Thus, continual re-evaluation of the patient’s \nresponse to treatment and the patient’s emerging clinical \nfindings is important for providing optimal interventions \nthroughout the patient’s episode of care.28\nComponent 3\nIrritability  is a term used by rehabilitation practitioners to \nreflect the tissue’s ability to handle physical stress,190,200 and is \npresumably related to physical status and the extent of injury \nand inflammatory activity that is present. McClure and Mi -\nchener190 proposed operational definitions for tissue irritabil -\nity for persons with shoulder pain that could be used to guide \nintensity and selection of interventions. These include high, \nmoderate, and low irritability levels, which are characterized \nby pain intensity and disability level, as well as provocation of there were no differences in 1-year outcomes between the \ncombined intervention and the combined intervention plus \nfoot orthoses.60\nEvidence Synthesis\nWhile combined interventions were different across studies, \nexercise therapy was present in all successful combined in -\ntervention programs.\nGaps in Knowledge\nWhile investigations demonstrate that combining interven -\ntions for the treatment of individuals with PFP is beneficial, \nthe best combination of exercise therapy and adjunctive \ntreatments is still unclear. It is likely that tailoring various \ncomponents of combined interventions may result in the \nbest patient outcomes. As of this guideline, it is yet unknown \nwhich criteria are most helpful in prescribing an interven -\ntion with the fewest components that yields the best patient \noutcomes.\nRecommendation\nAClinicians should combine physical therapy inter -\nventions for the treatment of individuals with PFP, \nwhich results in superior outcomes compared with \nno treatment, flat shoe inserts, or foot orthoses alone in the \nshort and medium term. Exercise therapy is the critical com -\nponent and should be the focus in any combined intervention \napproach. Interventions to consider combining with exercise \ntherapy include foot orthoses, patellar taping, patellar mobi -\nlizations, and lower-limb stretching.\nDECISION TREE MODEL\nA pathoanatomical/medical diagnosis of PFP can provide \nvaluable information in describing tissue pathology and may \nassist in nonoperative planning and prognosis. The proposed \nmodel for examination, diagnosis, and treatment planning \nfor patients with PFP uses the following components: (1) \nmedical screening, (2) classification of the condition through \nevaluation of clinical findings suggestive of musculoskeletal \nimpairments of body functioning (ICF) and associated tis -\nsue pathology/disease (ICD), (3) determination of irritability \nstage and psychosocial factors that may impact treatment, (4) \nevaluative outcome measures, and (5) nonoperative interven -\ntion strategies. This model is depicted in the FIGURE .\nComponent 1\nMedical screening incorporates the findings of the history \nand physical examination to determine whether the patient’s \nsymptoms originate from a condition that requires referral \nto another health care provider. Prior to diagnosing a person \nwith PFP, it is necessary to rule out all other possible medical \nconditions that may cause AKP.

Because \nirritability level often reflects the tissue’s ability to accept \nphysical stress, clinicians should match the most appropri -\nate intervention strategies to the irritability level of the pa -\ntient’s condition.28,157 Additionally, clinicians should consider \ninfluences from psychosocial factors9-11,186,187 in patients with \nconditions in all stages of recovery.\nLIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS\nMore research is needed to determine whether any long-term \ndifferences in pain or PROMs occur in patients with PFP who \nreceive either hip- or knee-targeted exercise therapy. More \nresearch is needed to gain greater understanding of outcome \ndifferences between patients who receive a combination of \nhip- and knee-targeted exercise therapy versus those who \nreceive knee-targeted exercise therapy alone. In addition, a \nstandardized approach is needed for future research when \ndelineating either knee- or hip-targeted exercise.\nDespite compelling evidence for the use of exercise therapy in \nthe treatment of people with PFP, exercise programs reported \nto be effective are unable to be replicated.143 Therefore, clini -\ncians treating PFP are encouraged to use accepted exercise \nprescription principles, as recommended by the American \nCollege of Sports Medicine,7,322 to guide exercise prescrip -\ntion targeting the hip and knee, based on individual deficits \nidentified in each patient. Specifically, the treating clinician \nshould assess, consider, and address appropriate neuromo -\ntor control, along with muscular endurance, strength, and \npower. Further guidance related to this is provided at https://\nipfrn.org/exercise-guide/ .\nThere is a long-held belief among experts that tailoring and \ntargeting treatment to individual patients may improve the \neffectiveness of physical therapy.18,80,310 However, to date, \nthere is little evidence for a validated approach to achieve \nthis. Nonetheless, the physical therapist is encouraged to use \nclinical reasoning to target interventions toward individuals \nwhen possible,18 and to use a shared decision-making process \nduring plan-of-care development.17pain with ROM.190 Because irritability level and the duration \nof symptoms do not always match, clinicians may be required \nto make judgments when applying time-based research re -\nsults to individual patients.28 Diagnosis of tissue irritability \nis important for guiding clinical decisions regarding treat -\nment frequency, intensity, duration, and type, with the goal \nof matching the optimal dosage of treatment to the status \nof the tissue being treated.28,157 Using an approach similar to \nthat proposed by McClure and Michener,190 clinicians should \nuse tissue irritability as a factor to consider when determin -\ning intervention type and intensity. Patients with PFP with \nhigh irritability (fairly constant pain greater than 5/10 that \nfluctuates related to activity) may benefit from interventions \nto reduce physical stress to the knee structures (eg, patel -\nlar taping). Those patients with low irritability (intermit -\ntent low-level pain less than 3/10 not easily aggravated) may \nbenefit from interventions that apply more physical stress to \nthe tissues of the knee, such as weight-bearing strengthen -\ning exercises, and thus provide appropriate stress to result in \nadaptation of structures to increased load.200\nComponent 4\nOutcome measures are standardized tools used for measur -\ning a specific domain, whether it is a body structure or func -\ntion, activity limitation, or participation restriction, or for \ndetermining a specific end point. They are important in di -\nrect management of individual patient care, and they provide \nthe opportunity to collectively compare care and determine \neffectiveness through the repeated application of a standard -\nized measurement. Outcomes in clinical practice provide the \nmechanism by which the health care provider, the patient, \nthe public, and the payer are able to assess the end results \nof care and its effect on the health of the patient and society. \nOutcome measurements can identify baseline pain, function, \nand disability, assess global knee function, determine readi -\nness to return to activities, and monitor changes in status \nthroughout treatment. Outcome measures can be classified \nas PROMs, physical performance measures, and physical \nimpairment measures. Information for outcome measures is \ndetailed in this CPG’s Examination section.\nComponent 5\nClinical signs and symptoms have typically guided the clinical \ndecision making of treatment interventions.
