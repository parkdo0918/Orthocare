Initial evaluation should emphasize excluding urgent causes while \nconsidering the need for referral. Key aspects of the patient history include age;  location, onset, duration, and quality of pain;  \nassociated mechanical or systemic symptoms;  history of swelling;  description of precipitating trauma;  and pertinent med -\nical or surgical history. Patients requiring urgent referral generally have severe \npain, swelling, and instability or inability to bear weight in association with \nacute trauma or have signs of joint infection such as fever, swelling, erythema, \nand limited range of motion. A systematic approach to examination of the knee \nincludes inspection, palpation, evaluation of range of motion and strength, neu -\nrovascular testing, and special (provocative) tests. Radiographic imaging should \nbe reserved for chronic knee pain (more than six weeks) or acute traumatic pain \nin patients who meet specific evidence-based criteria. Musculoskeletal ultraso -\nnography allows for detailed evaluation of effusions, cysts (e.g., Baker cyst), and \nsuperficial structures. Magnetic resonance imaging is rarely used for patients \nwith emergent cases and should generally be an option only when surgery is \nconsidered or when a patient experiences persistent pain despite adequate \nconservative treatment. When the initial history and physical examination suggest but do not confirm a specific diagnosis, \nlaboratory tests can be used as a confirmatory or diagnostic tool.

A popping sensation at the time of injury \nmay occur in meniscal or ligamentous tears. A knee that is \n“locked” in flexion and that cannot be extended should be \nexamined for a meniscal tear.4,14,15 \nSWELLING\nIf the patient has an acute injury, a knee joint effusion \nstrongly suggests internal derangement.14,26 Swelling that \noccurs immediately (minutes to a few hours) after injury \nsuggests a ligament rupture, intra-articular fracture, or \npatellar dislocation;  swelling that appears within hours to \na few days suggests a meniscal tear.15,19 Atraumatic swelling \nwith erythema or palpable warmth implies gout or pseudo -\ngout, arthritic flare, or infection. Swelling that is limited to \nthe borders of the patella suggests prepatellar bursitis.4,14,15 \nMECHANISM OF INJURY\nWhen determining the mechanism of injury, gather infor -\nmation about pain onset, positioning of the knee during \nand after the injury, and subsequent weight-bearing status \n(Table 11,3-27). Meniscal tears commonly result from twist -\ning injuries in the weight-bearing knee. Ligamentous rup -\nture may result from excess deceleration force applied to a \nweight-bearing, fixed, lower extremity or a direct blow to \nthe lateral or medial knee. A fracture should be considered \nwhen patients are unable to walk or limp at least four steps \nboth immediately after injury and at first presentation.9,29,30\nMEDICAL OR SURGICAL HISTORY\nFamily physicians should ask patients about previous knee \nor other joint pain, injuries, or surgeries. Physicians should \nalso inquire about systemic medical conditions (e.g., autoim -\nmune or infectious diseases, sexually transmitted infections) \nand review family history of autoimmune and degenera -\ntive conditions. Personal history of knee injury or surgery \nand family history of knee osteoarthritis or joint replace -\nment are established risk factors for knee osteoarthritis.20,21 Additional risk factors for knee osteoarthritis include age \nolder than 50 years, female gender, and being overweight.20\nPhysical Examination\nA systematic approach to examination of the knee includes \ninspection, palpation, range of motion and strength evalua -\ntion, neurovascular assessment, and special (provocative) tests.\nINSPECTION\nErythema, swelling, bruising, lacerations, gross deformity, \ndiscoloration, and any asymmetry of bony or soft tissue \nlandmarks, including atrophy and valgus or varus deformi -\nties, should be noted.\nPALPATION\nPalpation should assess for pain over all bony and soft tissue \nlandmarks (Figure 131), warmth, and effusion.

A joint that \nis as warm or warmer than the tissue above or below that \njoint indicates infection or inflammation. An evaluation \nfor effusion with the ballottement test and “milking” of the \nsuprapatellar pouch should be conducted with the patient \nsupine with the injured knee in extension.3 \nRANGE OF MOTION AND STRENGTH TEST\nRange of motion (active and then passive) and strength \ntesting (graded 0 to 5) should be used to assess flexion and \nextension of the knee. Normal limits of knee range of motion \ninclude extension from 0 to –10° and \nflexion to 135°.5 The examiner should \nassess for a lateral patellar tracking \n(“J” sign) vs. normal patellofemoral \ntracking during the range of motion \nexamination23,24,32,33 (see figure at \nhttps://  www.aafp.org/afp/2007/0115/\np194.html#afp20070115p194-f2).\nNEUROVASCULAR ASSESSMENT\nNeurovascular examination of the knee \nincludes assessment of sensation to light \ntouch;  deep tendon reflexes (graded 0 to \n4+) of the patellar and Achilles tendons;   \nand bilateral palpation of the popli -\nteal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial \npulses (graded 0 to 4+).10\nSPECIAL (PROVOCATIVE) TESTS\nSpecial (provocative) tests are used to \nbilaterally assess specific structures \nof the knee;  these tests vary in their \naccuracy (Table 25,11). Pain and effu -\nsion may limit the usefulness of these \ntests in the acute setting, requiring \nrepeat testing or deferment until effu -\nsion has subsided.11\nPatellar Apprehension Test. This test \ninvolves laterally shifting the patella \nand is a variant of the patellar mobil -\nity test;  both of these tests evaluate \nfor patellar subluxation6 (see figure at \nhttps:// www.aafp.org/afp/2007/0115/\np194.html#afp20070115p194-f3 ). \nPatellar tilt and patellar grind (or inhi -\nbition) testing (see figure at https:// \nwww.aafp.org/afp/2007/0115/p194.html#afp20070115p194-f5) can indicate patellofemoral pain \nsyndrome, as can assessment of core stability while the \npatient completes a single leg squat.\nLachman, Anterior Drawer, and Pivot Shift Tests. These \ntests evaluate for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury \n(Table 25,11 and Table 34,6,11,34). The Lachman test is the \nmost commonly used technique for assessing the ACL6,7 \n(Figure 26).\nGravity “Sag” Sign Near Extension, Active Reduction \n“Quad Activation” of Posterior Tibial Subluxation, and Pos -\nterior Drawer Tests. These tests evaluate for posterior collat -\neral ligament (PCL) injury6,34 (Table 34,6,11,34).

How -\never, with a 2% prevalence TABLE 3\nPhysical Examination Maneuvers for the Knee\nTest Description\nAnterior cruciate ligament tear\nAnterior drawer \ntest* With the patient supine on the examining table, flex the hip to 45° and the \nknee to 90°. Sit on the dorsum of the foot, wrap hands around the ham -\nstrings (ensuring that these muscles are relaxed), then pull and push the \nproximal part of the leg, testing the movement of the tibia on the femur. Do \nthese maneuvers in three positions of tibial rotation:  neutral, 30° externally \nrotated, and 30° internally rotated. A normal test result is no more than 6 to  \n8 mm of laxity.\nLachman test* With the patient supine on the examining table and the leg slightly externally \nrotated and flexed (20 to 30°) at the examiner’s side, stabilize the femur with \none hand and apply pressure to the back of the knee with the other hand, \nwith the thumb on the joint line. A positive test result is movement of the \nknee with a soft or mushy end point. \nPivot shift test* Fully extend the knee and rotate the foot internally. Apply a valgus (abduction) \nforce while progressively flexing the knee, watching and feeling for translation \nof the tibia on the femur.\nPosterior cruciate ligament tear\nPosterior drawer \ntest The patient should be supine on the examining table with knees flexed to \n90°. While standing at the side of the examination table, the physician looks \nfor posterior displacement of the tibia (posterior “sag” sign).4,6,34 The physi -\ncian then fixes the patient’s foot in neutral rotation (by sitting on the foot), \npositions thumbs at the tibial tubercle, and places fingers at the posterior \ncalf. The physician then pushes posteriorly and assesses for posterior dis -\nplacement of the tibia.\nGravity “sag” \nsign near exten -\nsion testIn a resting position with the distal femur on a 15-cm support and the heel \nresting on the examination table (20° of flexion), the unsupported proximal \ntibia displays a concave anterior contour.\nActive reduction \n“quad activation” \nof posterior tibial \nsubluxationWhen the patient raises the heel 2 to 3 cm, a normal anterior contour is \nrestored.\nMeniscal tear\nJoint-line \ntenderness Palpate medially or laterally along the knee to the joint line between the \nfemur and tibial condyles. Pain on palpation is a positive finding.\nMcMurray test † Flex the hip and knee maximally. Apply a valgus (abduction) force to the knee \nwhile externally rotating the foot and passively extending the knee. An audible \nor palpable snap or click with pain during extension suggests a tear of the \nmedial meniscus. For the lateral meniscus, apply a varus (adduction) stress \nduring internal rotation of the foot and passive extension of the knee.\nThessaly test ‡ Hold patient’s outstretched hands while the patient stands flat footed on the \nfloor, internally and externally rotating the affected leg three times with the \nknee flexed 20°. The unaffected leg should be flexed to avoid contact with the \nfloor. Patient-reported pain at the medial or lateral joint line is a positive finding.\nEffusion\nBallottement \ntest § Push the patella posteriorly with two or three fingers using a quick, sharp \nmotion.

The Ottawa Knee Rule is a vali -\ndated tool (98.5% to 100% sensitivity, 49% specificity) that \ndecreases unnecessary radiography by 28% to 35% in the \npatient with an acutely injured knee.11,29,31,37-40 A prospective \nvalidation trial comparing the Ottawa Knee Rule and the \nPittsburgh Knee Rule showed that each rule is useful, but \nthe Pittsburgh rule appears to be more sensitive. Specifi -\ncally, the Ottawa rule had a sensitivity of 97% (95% confi -\ndence interval [CI], 90% to 99%) and specificity of 27% (95% \nCI, 23% to 30%), whereas the Pittsburgh Knee Rule yielded \na sensitivity of 99% (95% CI, 94% to 100%) and specificity of \n60% (95% CI, 56% to 64%)30 (Table 411). \nThe three recommended radiographic views are antero -\nposterior view, lateral view, and Merchant’s view (for the \npatellofemoral joint).30,40 Oblique views can assess for tibial \nplateau fractures, and the notch or tunnel (intracondylar) \nview can visualize osteochondral lesions.4 If osteoarthritis is \nsuspected, weight-bearing radiographs should be obtained \nto assess for joint-space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, \nosteophytes, and bony cysts.4,22ULTRASONOGRAPHY\nMusculoskeletal ultrasonography performed by a trained \nclinician13,25,41,42 allows for limited evaluation of effusions, \ncysts (e.g., Baker) and superficial tendons, collateral lig -\naments, muscles, vasculature, and nerves. In particular, \ndynamic evaluation of the extensor mechanism (quadriceps \ntendon, patella, and patellar tendon) can be readily assessed. \nMechanical complaints such as snapping, clicking, or pop -\nping can be evaluated through palpation with an ultrasound \ntransducer.40FIGURE 2\nLachman test.\nIllustration by Steve Oh\nReprinted with permission from Smith BW, Green GA.
