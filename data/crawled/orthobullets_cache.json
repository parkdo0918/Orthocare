It is the most common form of arthritis affecting the knee.\n\nEpidemiology:\n- Prevalence increases with age, affecting >10% of adults over 60\n- More common in women than men (ratio 1.5-2:1)\n- Risk factors include age, obesity (BMI >30), prior knee injury, and genetic predisposition\n\nPathophysiology:\n- Progressive cartilage degeneration with subchondral bone changes\n- Osteophyte formation at joint margins\n- Synovial inflammation and joint effusion\n- Meniscal degeneration often coexists\n\nClinical Presentation:\n- Gradual onset of pain, worse with weight-bearing and activity\n- Morning stiffness lasting <30 minutes (distinguishes from inflammatory arthritis)\n- Joint crepitus on movement\n- Decreased range of motion\n- Varus or valgus deformity in advanced cases\n\nDiagnosis:\n- Clinical criteria: Age >50, morning stiffness <30 min, crepitus, bony tenderness, bony enlargement\n- Radiographic findings: Joint space narrowing, osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis, cysts\n- Kellgren-Lawrence grading system (0-4)\n\nTreatment:\n- Conservative: Weight loss, physical therapy, NSAIDs, intra-articular injections\n- Surgical: Arthroscopy (limited role), osteotomy, unicompartmental or total knee arthroplasty",
